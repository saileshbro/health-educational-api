      "disease": "Acid Reflux Disease",
      "description": "When we eat food, it travels through the mouth to the food pipe (esophagus) and then to the stomach. Once in the stomach, food cannot come back up into the esophagus under normal conditions because of the presence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). LES is a group of fiber muscle rings at the lower end of the food pipe which acts as a one-way valve. In normal condition, it is tightly constricted and opens or relaxes only when we swallow food. When the sphincter becomes incompetent or doesn’t close properly, the acidic contents of the stomach leak into the esophagus. This condition is known as reflux and can irritate and damage the inner lining of the esophagus leading to gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux disease. Population-based studies have shown that up to 15% of individuals have the symptoms of reflux at least once a week and 7% have symptoms daily.",

Population-based studies have shown that up to 15% of individuals have the symptoms of reflux at least once a week and 7% have symptoms daily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes of GERD</code><ul><li><span>Decreased tone of LES is the main reason for GERD.</span><ul><li><span> It can occur due to excessive smoking, &nbsp;alcohol consumption, caffeine intake and disease called scleroderma. </span></li><li><span>Various medications also cause or worsen GERD important one &nbsp;are – nitrates, calcium channel blockers, progestin</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Conditions that increase the overall stomach volume and pressure can cause GERD like large meals, pregnancy, obesity, fluid accumulation inside the abdomen, and tight clothing, bending over can also lead to GERD.</span></li><li><span>A hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, a muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities) can also lead to reflux. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the symptoms of GERD?</code><ul><li><span>heartburn or a burning pain in the chest,</span></li><li><span>feeling that food is stuck behind the breastbone after it is swallowed and </span></li><li><span>nausea after eating. </span></li><li><span>the bringing up of the food into the mouth or regurgitation can cause sourness in the mouth. </span></li><li><span>reflux of the stomach contents into the throat and respiratory passage can cause cough, pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. </span></li><li><span>difficulty in swallowing the food, hiccups, hoarseness or change in voice, excessive belching and sore throat are other common symptoms of GERD.</span></li><li><span>severe GERD can lead to erosions in the inner lining of the esophagus which can cause bleeding.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Complication of GERD</code><ul><li><span>Narrowing of the food pipe by strictures. Repeated burning of the lining of the stomach leads to scar formation that can narrow the foodpipe causing food to get stuck.</span></li><li><span>Development of esophageal ulcer from severe damage to the lining by the acid. It can bleed and cause pain during swallowing. </span></li><li><span>Development of Barrett’s esophagus which increases the risk of cancer and needs endoscopy to monitor the progression of the disease.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is GERD diagnosed?</code><p>GERD is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms reported by the patients. Health Care Providers may consider additional diagnostics when the symptoms get complicated or persist for a long time, or there is no response to therapy. In such cases, an endoscopy may be performed which helps to visualize the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine by inserting a small camera that down the throat. Esophageal manometry is another test which is used to measure the pressure inside the lower part of the esophagus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is GERD treated?</code><p>The goal of the treatment is to provide relief from symptoms and heal erosive lesions and complications if any. Mild symptoms can be managed by weight reduction, sleeping with the head of the bed elevated by about 4-6 inches and elimination of the factors that increase stomach pressure. Patients should not smoke and should avoid consuming fatty foods, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, mint, orange juice and certain medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, anticholinergic agents, calcium channel blockers and smooth muscle relaxants. You should avoid eating heavy meals and consuming a lot of liquids with meals. Preferred painkillers for those suffering from GERD are acetaminophen and paracetamol.</p><p>For treating mild cases of acid reflux disease, health care providers may use drugs like cimetidine and ranitidine. These drugs help to reduce the acid secretion in the stomach. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are useful in symptom relief and are commonly used in combination with over the counter antacids syrups. Patients are recommended to take these drugs 15-30 minutes before daily meals. Healthcare providers may recommend anti-reflux surgery for those patients with persistent symptoms even after changes in lifestyle and medicines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

When kidney function declines slowly over a period it is called <em>chronic kidney disease</em> (failure). Acute kidney failure develops mainly in very sick hospitalised patients.</p><p>If you are healthy and young, acute kidney failure can resolve completely by itself, or you may develop a chronic kidney disease. The risk of developing a chronic kidney disease goes up with age and presence of other chronic medical conditions. Eventually kidney stops to work completely and the patient needs dialysis to remove body waste products and maintain salt and water balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code> <p>There are various causes of acute kidney failure. &nbsp;These include:</p><p><em>Decreased blood flow to the kidneys, which may be due to</em>:</p><ul> <li>loss of blood;</li><li>severe dehydration;</li><li>heart disease; or</li><li>low blood pressure.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Damage to the kidneys, which may be due to:</em></p><ul> <li>infections such as, pneumonia or blood infection;</li><li>inflammation of kidneys mainly after skin or heart infection;</li><li>medicines such as, painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen, drugs used in cancer treatments or antibiotics; </li><li>toxins such as&nbsp;cocaine, heavy metals, lithium, propylene glycol ingestion;</li><li>autoimmune diseases – lupus, vasculitis (autoimmune disease of vessels},</li><li>blood clots in the veins and arteries of the kidney; or</li><li>multiple myeloma.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blockage to the normal pathway, due to:</em></p><ul> <li>cancer of bladder, ureteral or pelvic organs;</li><li>enlarged prostate;</li><li>kidney stones; or</li><li>blood clots in urinary tracts.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code> <p>There are no specific symptoms in early stage of the disease.

People who suffer from allergies are usuallysensitive to more than one allergens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms </code><p>Allergy manifests as different symptoms based on the organs ( nose, throat, lungs, sinuses, ear, skin andgastrointestinal tract) involved. Signs and Symptoms range from mild symptoms of itchiness, rash, runny nosewatery/red eyes to a life threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Moderately severe symptoms includeswelling of airway causing breathing difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Types of Allergic Diseases</code><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic Rhinitis</code><p>Allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, mostly occurs during spring and fall due to airborne pollens. It isalso called seasonal rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis can occur in response to allergens that are presentthroughout the year like animal dander, proteins derived from cockroaches, mold spores and dust. This iscalled perennial allergic rhinitis. Symptoms include sneezing, stuffy or running nose, obstruction of thenasal passage, itching in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, pharynx and roof of the mouth. In susceptiblepeople, symptoms generally appear before the fourth decade of life and tend to diminish gradually withaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Urticaria</code><p>Also known as hives, urticaria is characterized by red bumps on the skin of varying sizes that occur ingroups. These involve the upper part of the skin and may be associated with swelling and itching. Urticariais often associated with swelling. Atopic dermatitis or eczema is another skin manifestation of allergy withsymptoms like itching, reddening and peeling of the skin. More than half of the people with atopicdermatitis have been found to develop asthma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic conjunctivitis</code><p>When eye is exposed to specific allergic agents, it shows the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis likeitching, reddening, swelling of the conjunctiva and watering of the eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Asthma</code><p>Allergy plays a significant role in pathogenesis and manifestation of disease. Details discussed elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Food allergy</code><p>Food allergy occurs when the immune system of the body recognizes a particular food protein as an allergen.Even tiny amount of the food is enough to trigger the allergic reaction. Most common type of food items thattrigger allergic reaction are cow’s milk, peanuts, egg protein, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish and tree nuts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Allergic Sinusitis</code><p>Sinuses are hollow cavities within the face around our eyes and behind the nose. Allergy can triggerinflammation in these sinuses which produces nasal congestion, cough, fever and thick, dirty nasaldischarge. This condition is known as allergic rhino-sinusitis. People with asthma and allergic rhinitis aremore likely to suffer from sinusitis because of frequent involvement of airways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Anaphylaxis</code><p>Anaphylaxis is a severe form of allergic reaction which is life threatening. It can affect more than one bodypart at the same time. Symptoms include red itchy rash, lightheadedness, difficulty in breathing, tightnessin the throat and chest, anxiety, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. Anaphylactic reaction canmanifest as shock when there is sudden fall in the blood pressure which leads to loss of consciousness.Agents known to cause anaphylaxis are food items, insect bites, wasp sting, latex and various types ofdrugs. Since it is a life threatening condition, anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention whichincludes maintenance of airway, breathing and circulation as first aid and injection of epinephrine astreatment. Urgent hospital admission is required when symptoms of anaphylaxis are seen. If not treated ontime, anaphylactic reactions can also be fatal due to respiratory failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis and Treatment</code><p>A thorough medical history and physical examination is required to identify allergy. Family history ofallergy and history of environmental exposure to allergen is equally important. Allergy skin testing orpatch testing with blood examination is also performed in order to determine the type of allergic agentinvolved.</p><p>Once a specific allergen is identified, you should try to avoid exposure to the offending agents. Drugs suchas antihistamines and decongestants in form of tablets can be prescribed in order to relieve the allergysymptoms. Topical nasal sprays are helpful in treating nasal symptoms. Severe symptoms not controlled byavoidance and medications can be sometimes treated by immunotherapy called “allergy shots”. In thistreatment, doctor gives you a series of injection of the allergen extract under your skin over a long periodof time so that you develop tolerance to the allergen. If you had an anaphylactic reaction before, yourdoctor will ask you to carry an “epi-pen” that contains epinephrine that you can inject under the skin whenyou feel you might be having an anaphylaxis. Although there is no cure for allergy once diagnosed, followingthe advice from the physician and appropriate modification in lifestyle can protect from allergic reactionsin the future.</p></ul></div>"

There are two types of these inhaledmedicines.They are:</span></p><code>Reliever medicines:</b><span> These are used whenever you feel shortness ofbreath. These medication effect start quick but last for short period. These medicines are taken 4-6times daily. Mild cases of asthma can be managed with this short acting inhalers. </span></p><code>Controller medicines: </b><span>When asthma symptoms are more frequent you needa medicine that last longer. </span><b>&nbsp;</b><span>These are taken onlyonce or twice daily. </span></p><p><span>Some asthma attacks can be managed at home some need hospital admission. Ifyou get hospitalised, you will be given oxygen. Asthma attacks are usually treated with oral steroids.</span></p><p><span>There are certain conditions associated with asthma that makes asthma controldifficult. Diagnosing and treating those conditions are also very important. Those conditions includeobesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sinusitis and obstructive sleep apnea. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span>You may have an increased genetic susceptibility to asthma but you can modifythe environmental risk factors to prevent asthma or its episodes of attack:</span></p><ul><li><span>Avoid &nbsp;things that make your asthmasymptoms worse. </span><span>Smoking or exposure to smoking should bestrictly avoided. Regular dusting of carpets and curtains, avoiding pets or dolls with fur andpollens in certain seasons and keeping&nbsp;yourself from catching cold would help you get rid ofasthma attacks.</span></li><li><span>Physical activity might make your symptomsworse&nbsp;but&nbsp;it&nbsp;is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. </span></li><li><span>Take your medicines regularly, if any, as yourdoctor prescribes. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Talk to your doctor, if you think yourmedicine is not working properly to manage your asthma.</span></li><li><span>Always communicate with your doctor if youhave difficulty following your treatment plan or need to make changes.</span></li></ul></ul></div>"

It is a generic term that encompasses hundreds of conditions where joint inflammation causes symptoms of pain, swelling and stiffness of joints. Two most common causes of arthritis are Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Arthritis can be caused by infections, crystals and other autoimmune diseases. Arthritis is usually a disease of old age that is more common in women and overweight people. </span></p><p><b>Osteoarthritis</b><span> occurs when the cartilage—which is the slippery tissue covering the bones at which areas they form a joint—is damaged due to regular, excessive wear and tear. Most commonly affected joints are hips, knees, and spine and hands and fingers, but ankles, elbows, shoulders and wrists joints are also affected, although less frequently. Symptoms are limited to joints without involvement of other organs.</span></p><p><span>Risk factors for development of osteoarthritis include increasing age, being a woman, injuries or deformities to the joint, obesity, and occupations with repetitive joint movements.</span></p><p><b>Rheumatoid arthritis</b><span> occurs when cells of your immune system attack the normal tissues in your joint. It not only affects joints but also affect other organs, such as heart, lungs and cause extensive symptoms. </span></p><p><span>Risk factors for RA include family history, being a woman&nbsp;and age. </span></p><p><b>Other</b><span>&nbsp;types of arthritis include:</span></p><ul><li><span>septic (infectious arthritis) – bacteria gets entry to the joint via blood. It causes inflammation of the joint. The joint is exquisitely painful and slight movement elicits excruciating pain. Tuberculosis bacteria can also cause infectious arthritis but is not as painful as other bacteria. Once the infection resolves, extensive damage is&nbsp;done to the joint. </span></li><li><span>arthritis due to presence of crystals in the joint (gout): high uric acid in the blood gets deposited in the joint and cause inflammation. </span></li><li><span>autoimmune diseases (lupus): similar to RA, other immune disease like SLE and psoriasis also can cause arthritis. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Pain, swelling and stiffness of the joints are the common symptoms of all arthritis. Joints are hot to touch on palpation of the joint. Severity of symptoms depend on site and numbers of joints involved. In osteoarthritis, pain is worse during ambulation and improves with rest whereas in RA the joint stiffness and pain improves on walking. In OA you will not feel symptoms outside of the joints. But in other cases you may have fever, fatigue and tiredness. Pain is excruciating in septic arthritis and gout. If arthritis is from autoimmune disease like SLE and RA you may experience symptoms like cough, chest pain or skin rash and difficulty eating. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>If you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints, you should consult your doctor. The doctor will listen to your symptoms and also perform a physical exam. Your doctor will assess for swelling and redness around joints, limited mobility of joints etc. Your doctor will also order following tests:</span></p><ul><li><span>Blood test and analysis of joint fluid: your doctor may aspirate the joint with a needle and look for signs of infection and presence of crystals. Blood test help to identify the cause like RA and SLE. You will have an elevated Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in your blood if you have RA. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>X-ray, MRI, CT scan of the joints are done to find out type and extent of damages and also to rule out other &nbsp;conditions.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>The main aim of treatment is to reduce pain and prevent further damage. Treatments vary &nbsp;depending upon the type of arthritis you have. &nbsp;Exercising and maintaining a healthy weight will always help. The treatment modalities may include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Medicines: Acetaminophen and other NSAIDs are given for pain relief and to reduce inflammation. Apart from the analgesics and NSAID, drugs that modulate your immune system are required for RA. &nbsp;These are called disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These medication prevent further destruction of your joints. At the same time they also increase your risk of catching infection in other organs. </span></li><li><span>Therapy: Other non-pharmacological measures like physical therapy, occupational therapy, use of braces to support joints, etc. are recommended to improve function and strengthen muscles. </span></li><li><span>Surgery and other procedures: Injection of cortisone into the joints for pain relief and joint repair or replacements are needed in some cases.</span></li><li><span>Alternative therapy: Although commonly used, no alternative therapy method has been proven superior to placebo. Some of the treatment options&nbsp;that are promising are glucosamine, acupuncture, yoga and&nbsp;tai chi.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

The goal of treatment is to maximise your child’s ability to function by reducing ASD symptoms and supporting development and learning. Every child with autism is unique so the treatment plan is individualized to meet specific needs. The mainstay of treatment therapies are behavioural and communication therapies, education therapies, family therapies and medications to alleviate symptoms like anxiety, depression or behavioural problems. </span></p><p><span>The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that parents themselves can give psychosocial and behavioral treatments to the child with autism. If your child has autism spectrum disorder, you can help improve your child’s language and social skills so that your child can adjust to the needs of his daily life. However, they will need some support throughout the life. </span></p><p><span>Once you suspect your child is having the ASD like symptoms, talk to the specialist as soon as possible. It is best to begin intervention sooner than later, so the benefits of therapy can continue on throughout the course of life. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span>There are no preventive measures for autism since the exact cause is not known. In many cases, the symptoms of autism becomes less pronounced as child gets older. Some people with autism go to live typical lives, but often continue needing services and support even as they grow older.</span></p></ul></div>"

      "body": "<div><ul><code>Introduction</code><p>Blood cancer encompasses cancers that originate in the bone marrow (organ that produces blood cells). Most of the blood cancers involve white blood cells (cells that fight infection) and are called leukemia. Cancers can also develop in the red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen) and platelets (cells that help stop bleeding). When these abnormal white blood cells grow out of control in the bone marrow, it spills into the blood causing abnormally high circulating white blood cells which are incapable of fighting infection. In addition, too many white blood cells in the bone marrow displace other normal red blood cells and platelets and resulting in anemia and bleeding tendencies.</p><p>Based on the type of white blood cells involved, leukemia can be classified as lymphocytic or myelocytic. Each of these types can be either acute (rapid progression) or chronic (slow progression). Here are the four broad types of leukemia:</p><ul><li>Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)</li><li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</li><li>Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML)</li><li>Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within these broad categories there are subtypes of leukemia.</p><p>Blood cancer can occur at any age. Some type of blood cancer are more common in children (ALL) while others are more common in adults (AML, CML, CLL). Blood cancer, unlike other cancers, usually does not produce a mass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risk Factors</strong><br> The exact factors producing leukemia are not yet well-known. Research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors &nbsp;may play a role for leukemia such as the following:</p><ul><li>Chemotherapy: Certain types of chemotherapy (for other cancer) increase risk of blood cancer.<br> Exposure to industrial chemicals like benzene.</li><li>Radiation: Exposure to high-level radiation may lead of greater chance of having blood cancer</li><li>Certain genetic disease like Down’s syndrome</li><li>A family history of leukemia</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not all people who develop leukemia will have these risk factors. Furthermore people with theses risk factors may not develop leukemia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><ul><li>Fever, chills due to infections as white blood cells that fight infection are abnormal</li><li>Tiredness, dizziness or breathlessness because of anemia</li><li>Easy bleeding because of low platelets, recurrent nose bleeding</li><li>Tiny red spots, bruises under the skin</li><li>Fever, night sweats</li><li>Bone and joint pain</li><li>Loss of appetite, weight loss</li><li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to see a doctor</code><p>As symptoms of blood cancer are often vague and nonspecific, you should seek medical attention if these symptoms are persistent and worry you. If you had cancer and were in remission and develop above symptoms, it might be an indication that the cancer might have come back and you should call your doctor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Depending on the type of leukemia, it may be diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms and a blood test or if the leukemia is of chronic in nature it might be picked up during a routine blood test as these slow growing leukemia can be asymptomatic.</p><p>Physical exam will reveal enlarged lymphnodes in neck, armpit, and enlarged liver and spleen (organs in abdomen).<br> Blood test will show high number of abnormal blood cell. Finally a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis that shows abnormal white blood cells.<br> Specialized molecular and genetic tests are performed on cancer cells to further subtype the leukemia that may be helpful in guiding treatment options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>There are different ways to treat leukemia depending on specific type of blood cancer, age, extent of spread and the risk category.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Leukemia is treated by one or more of the following</code><ul><li>Chemotherapy: This means drugs are used to kill cancer cells. These are given in cycles over a long period of time. Chemotherapy has the potential to damage normal cells in our body and produce side effects like hair fall, repeated infections, liver damage etc.</li><li>Targeted immunologic and biologic therapy: these drugs only target the abnormal cancer cell sparing patient from side effects of killing normal cells.</li><li>Radiation therapy: A particular strength of radiation is used to kill the cancer cells.</li><li>Bone marrow transplant: This is an advanced method of treating blood cancer by replacing cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy</li><li>Surgery: In some cases enlarged spleen is removed by surgery.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While treating leukemia, the doctor will ask you to do regular follow up. It is necessary to examine and test for different side effects of the drug or radiation. You have to report your doctor or nurse about any problems that occur in between. You have to follow your doctor’s instructions on hygiene, diet and follow up to make sure that you avoid complications. Some complications can be so serious that you may need hospitalization, transfusion of blood products and sometimes may even be life-threatening.</p><p>The doctor will also look for signs or test reports that indicate the cancer has come back. If the cancer comes back you may need more aggressive chemotherapy, radiation therapy or sometimes bone marrow transplantation.</p><p>As with any cancer therapy, you and your family should talk to your doctor or nurse about following aspects of your treatment before you embark on treatment path:</p><ul><li>Benefits of the treatment you are receiving</li><li>Problems or side effects associated with the treatment</li><li>Other options besides this treatment</li><li>Risk of not receiving the treatment</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A fatal disease until the 1960’s, people with leukemia live longer these days. Ninety percent of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia achieve remission and nearly half are cured with current treatments. While adults with leukemia have a better chance of survival than before it is less favorable compared to children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

Usually viral exanthems are self limiting and disappear in few days . However these rashes should be evaluated to rule out other serious diseases like meningococcal infection, scarlet fever or Kawasaki disease. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>Many viral infections can cause skin rashes. Common viral infections are:</span></p><ul><li><b>Measles (Rubeola):</b><span> &nbsp;The disease is also called 10 days measles. The rash first appears on face, particularly behind the ears, then spreads to chest, abdomen, arms and legs. The rash is red and raised and granular. It appears on the fourth day of fever and lasts for 4-7 days. &nbsp;It takes 6-12 days for a child to develop symptoms after getting exposed to the virus. But the child may transmit the virus to others &nbsp;even before (1-2 days) the onset of symptoms and 3-4 days after development of rashes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Chicken pox:</b><span> The rash starts as a red flat rash that soon become raised and later becomes fluid filled that ruptures and forms crusts before healing completely. Lesions at different stage are seen as new rashes continue to form for several days. It start on the trunk and spreads to limbs. &nbsp;Appears on the first day of fever and lasts for 4-10 days. It may take 10-12 days for a child to develop symptoms after exposure. They are contagious 1-2 days before onset of rash until the rash crusts.</span></li><li><b>Rubella: </b><span>Also called German measles. The rash and disease is usually mild and transient. The rash starts from face or neck and then to trunk and limbs. &nbsp;It is pink or light red in color. Major health concern from Rubella is in pregnant women. If a pregnant woman acquires Rubella in pregnancy it can cause significant damage to the fetus. It takes 2-3 weeks for a child to develop symptoms after getting exposed to Rubella. They are contagious 7 days before the onset of the rash to 14 days after the rash disappears.</span></li><li><b>Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease)</b><span>: &nbsp;The rashes begin with the classic slapped-cheek appearance. Bright red raised rashes appear abruptly over the cheeks, sparing area around the nose, mouth and eyes. Later on, red rashes spread to arms and trunk which fades into a lace like reticular pattern. Up to two weeks may elapse before a child exposed to the virus develops any symptoms. A child can transmit virus before onset of rash and up to 20 percent may not have any symptoms and still transmit the virus. </span></li><li><b>Roseola: </b><span>A pink rash, with either flat or raised lesions, starts to appear on the trunk and then spreads to the face, arms and legs. This disease causes very high fever and a infected child is at risk of developing seizures. The rash appears as fever subsides. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rashes may occur with other viral infections, such as &nbsp;Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, echoviruses and coxsackieviruses. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Before rashes appear, a prodrome of symptoms are seen in all viral exanthems. The prodrome symptoms include fever, cough, headache, malaise, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, muscle aches, joint pain, runny nose, swollen neck glands or eyelids. &nbsp;The duration and intensity of symptoms depend on different virus and in different individuals. As the disease progresses, these symptoms begin to subside or new symptoms of complication begin to appear. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>Diagnosis is made on the basis of evolution symptoms, timing and distribution of the rashes. Many exanthema have distinct patterns of rashes and prodromal (pre-rash) symptoms allowing to make a clinical diagnosis. However, the rashes may be nonspecific in some cases and diagnosis can only be confirmed with blood tests or isolation of viruses. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>There is no specific treatment for viral exanthema and the rashes usually resolve in a week or two. Treatment &nbsp;is usually symptomatic and supportive. Still viral exanthemas (rashes) require clinical care by a physician as it needs to be&nbsp;monitored for appearance of any complications and for specific advice about prevention of transmission to other people. </span><span>Some serious bacterial infections can also produce rashes, so the doctor needs to evaluate and make sure that you get appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</span></p><p><span>Symptomatic treatment includes paracetamol/acetaminophen for fever, skin moisturiser for itching. &nbsp;Aspirin should be avoided for treatment of fever due to the risk of complication known as Reye’s syndrome in some children. In cases of measles, large doses of Vitamin A is given to treat possible complications in the eyes and to help you prevent acquiring secondary bacterial infection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span>Vaccinations against &nbsp;measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox &nbsp;is the most important aspect of prevention and management of viral exanthems. Prevention of spread of infection is another important measure in prevention. &nbsp;Children should not attend school or daycare for a period mentioned above depending on the disease type and state. </span></p></ul> </div>"

If the abnormal growth (tumor) doesn’t have the invading and spreading property , it is called a benign (non cancerous) tumor.</p><p>Cancer can originate in any part of the body. The original site is called the primary cancer. When cancer spreads to other organ, it is called a metastases or a secondary cancer. Once the cancer spreads beyond the primary organ, it cannot be cured. Prognosis and treatment options of a patient with cancer depends on the organ of origin, size of the tumor and the spread of the cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Cause of Cancer</code><p>Cancer is caused by unwanted changes (mutations) in the genetic information contained in our DNA. These mutation can run down in families or these can be acquired over time. However, having these mutation doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop a cancer. It means you are more likely to develop a cancer when you are exposed to other cancer causing substances or environment called risk factors. In many cases of cancer the risk factors remain unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk Factors</code><ul><li>Age- risk of cancer increase as you grow older but cancer can occur at any age.</li><li>Lifestyle factors:<ul><li>Smoking – increases risk of many cancer like lung cancer, cancer of mouth, head and neck.</li><li>Alcohol- head and neck cancer, esophagus, breast cancer, colorectal cancer.</li><li>Unsafe and early sexual encounter- cervical cancer</li><li>Diet/nutrition: food high in cholesterol, high consumption of smoked food, obesity and lack of physical activity.</li></ul></li><li>Radiation exposure from sun or during cancer treatment or from frequent imagings.</li><li>Environmental factors:<ul><li>Occupational exposure to asbestos, cancer causing chemicals like benzene, pesticides, radiation etc</li><li>Passive second hand smoking</li><li>Air pollution</li></ul></li><li>Infections like Human Papilloma Virus, Hepatitis B</li><li>Diseases like ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis of liver, HIV/AIDS</li><li>Hormonal therapy</li><li>Family history of cancer</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Cancer doesn’t cause symptoms until the late stage and when present they are often vague. Sign and symptoms could be localised to the organ involved in earlier stage. Some general symptoms of cancer include:</p><ul><li>Unexplained loss of weight</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Unusual lump or swelling anywhere</li><li>Skin changes</li><li>Unexplained bleeding or bruising</li><li>Change in bowel habits like persistent constipation, diarrhea.</li><li>Cough or difficulty breathing</li><li>Difficulty swallowing, indigestion</li><li>Ulcer in mouth that is difficult to heal</li><li>Unexplained fever or night sweats.</li><li>Hoarseness of voice</li><li>Blood in urine or stool, difficulty in urination</li><li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</li><li>New mole or change in mole</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>If you feel that you have any of the above mentioned symptoms and are being worrisome, you should consult your doctor. The doctor will look for any abnormalities associated with the symptoms by performing physical examination and various tests. The tests are applied depending on where the cancer is suspected. These tests could also be a part of your regular follow up.</p><ul><li>Blood tests</li><li>Imaging: X-ray, Ultrasound,CT scan, MRI</li><li>Endoscopy, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy etc</li><li>Bone marrow tests, Lumbar puncture</li><li>Biopsy: a sample of the tissue is taken to test microscopically to make a certain diagnosis</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Screening</code><p>Cancers can be detected early by performing screening tests in apparently healthy persons. The cancers that can be screened are:</p><ul><li>Breast cancer: screened by Self breast examination and mammogram.</li><li>Cervical cancer: screened by ‘Pap smear’.</li><li>Colon cancer: screened by visualization of intestines through colonoscope, sigmoidoscope etc.</li><li>Prostate cancer: screened by physical examination and ‘PSA’ test.</li><li>Lung cancer: screened by special kind of X-ray called ‘low dose CT scan’.</li><li>Ovarian cancer: screened by blood tests and ultrasound.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>The treatment of cancer varies according to the type, size, stage and spread of cancer. The aim of cancer treatment is to cure the cancer (if in early stage}, control its progression and ease the associated symptoms.</p><ul><li>Commonly there are three types of treatment options and are usually used in combination:<ul><li>Surgery: The cancer part is cut out from the affected body part.</li><li>Chemotherapy: The doctors use special kind of medicines to kill the cancer cells or to stop them from growing further.</li><li>Radiation therapy: The doctors use high energy radiation on the cancerous part to kill the cancer cells or to stop them from growing further.</li></ul></li><li>Other newer treatment methods are also being used these days like bone marrow transplant, hormone therapy, immune therapy and other special techniques (e.g. cutting off blood supply to tumor)</li><li>Supportive treatment: medicines and other therapy for pain, nutrition support, recreation therapy etc</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Follow up</code><p>Once you are diagnosed with cancer you need a regular follow up. Follow up involves review of history, physical examination and necessary investigations. The aim of follow up is to check for recurrence or spread, to prevent or early detect other cancers, treat ongoing problems related to cancer and address the long term physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer after treatment. In addition, the doctor will provide you counseling on nutrition, fertility, pain management etc as well as refer you for occupational/ vocational therapy as required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>At least one in three cancer cases are preventable and the number of cancer deaths could be reduced significantly by choosing a healthy lifestyle. You can prevent cancer by avoiding the above mentioned risk factors of cancer like smoking, alcoholism, poor diet, inactivity and obesity etc. Periodic screening and early detection are also effective preventive measures. You should get immunized for cervical cancer if available in your place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

It can affect any organ in the body but lungs (Pulmonary TB) are the most common site of infection. Other common sites of infection are bones, lymph nodes, kidneys, uterus, brain (meninges}, skin, etc.</p><p>Tuberculosis is transmitted from one person to another by inhalation of droplets released into the air by an infected person when they sneeze or cough. Transmission is high in crowded area with high humidity. Entry of bacteria into the lungs causes mild illness called primary tuberculosis. Usually it doesn’t lead to significant disease and resolves after body’s immune system traps and localises the organism into a small area in the lung called ghon’s focus where it remains dormant for long period. Later, when body defenses become weak, these dormant bacteria reactivate and cause significant disease called secondary tuberculosis. Most of the tuberculosis in adults are reactivation tuberculosis. A large proportion of population in developing countries have been exposed to TB and have dormant bacteria in the lungs and are at risk of reactivation tuberculosis. Tuberculosis had become a rare disease in developing countries but its prevalence is increasing after HIV/AIDS became common.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Natural course of Tuberculosis</code><p>There are two stages of tuberculosis</p><ol><li>Latent TB: Once infected with tuberculosis bacteria, one is never cured of it. Most of the time it lies dormant in the lungs without causing any symptoms and is called latent TB. The risk of reactivation increases when body’s immune system goes down. Latent TB needs to be treated, even in absence of symptoms, to prevent the risk of full blown active tuberculosis later. It is treated with isoniazid for six months. TB is not transmissible at this stage.</li><li>Active tuberculosis: This is when you develop signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. This may follow immediately after the first exposure without going into the latent phase or it can develop many years later after the first mildly symptomatic primary infection goes into dormancy. You can spread the disease during this stage.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms of active Tuberculosis</code><p>Here are some of the symptoms of active tuberculosis:</p><ul><li>cough for more than two weeks</li><li>streaks of blood in cough</li><li>low grade fever in da</li><li>night sweats</li><li>chest pain</li><li>unexplained weight loss</li><li>pallor (anemia)</li><li>anorexia; malaise with general weakness and other associated features</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Common Causes/ Risk Factors</code><p>Causative agent of tuberculosis is <em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em> in most of the cases. Other bacteria are <em>Mycobacterium Bovis</em> and <em>Mycobacterium Africanum</em>.

      "body": "<div> <ul> <code>Meaning: </code><p>Tingling and numbness are the loss of normal sensation in the various parts of body. Tingling is the prickling sensation also known as pins and needles and it is usually felt in hands and feet. Numbness is when one cannot feel any sensation in part of his/her body.</p><code>Why does it Matter?</code><p>You will generally experience numbness or pins and needles when you are sitting crossed-legs because awkward positions such as that press your nerves or blood vessels that supply to those nerves. When you have some disease that traps or presses the nerves, you will feel numbness or tingling, as it is those nerves that carry such sensations to the brain. It can sometimes be a sign of some serious diseases like diabetes or problem of the spine.</p><p>Tingling is experienced as an unpleasant feeling in a specific area like that of pin pricks or shooting pain which can travel down from arm to leg or any one of them. You do not feel anything even if you are pricked with needle on the specific area where you feel the numbness.</p><code>Causes:</code><p>There are various causes of tingling and numbness but only few of those that are common or important are discussed as follows:</p><ol><li><strong> Trapped nerve:</strong> Tingling and numbness can be caused by a trapped nerve due to back issues or prolapsed disc etc. The nerve gets trapped because of the pressure exerted on it hence causing pins and needles anywhere in the body, from head to toe, depending on where it is trapped. This may also impair the function of the part of body affected. There is a condition called carpel tunnel syndrome in which nerve trapping occurs at wrist resulting in the loss of grip as well as pain, tingling and numbness at affected hand.</li><li><strong> Pressure:</strong> If undue pressure is exerted on the nerves due to prolonged sitting on feet or wearing tight clothing, for example, it can cause tingling and numbness. This is usually reversible which means, if the pressure is relieved on time it gets better and has no serious consequences.</li><li><strong> Injury:</strong> Injury to a nerve can cause numbness and tingling in the part of body being supplied by the affected nerve. For example if nerve in neck is injured, numbness could be felt anywhere along the arm whereas back injury might cause the same in legs.</li><li><strong> Diabetes</strong>: When the blood sugar is not under control for several years, there can be damage in the small nerves beginning in the fingers and toes, hands and feet. This is called peripheral neuropathy. When you are unable to feel with your legs or hands, there is risk of injury from burn, prick, fall etc.</li><li><strong> Medicines:</strong> There are some medicines whose side effects are numbness or tingling resulting from the nerve damage. Such medicines include anticancer drugs, antiretroviral or antitubercular drugs, metronidazole etc. People who take a lot of alcohol and tobacco develop serious conditions that cause tingling or numbness.</li><li><strong> Vitamin Deficiency:</strong> Strict vegetarians and people with disease called pernicious anemia have deficiency of Vitamin B 12 which can cause tingling and numbness, apart from anemia.</li><li><strong> Diseases that damage nerves:</strong> There are several diseases which affect the nervous system and cause tingling or numbness. Some of them are stroke, brain tumors and multiple sclerosis. Though they are relatively rare as cause of numbness or tingling, they are very serious conditions.</li></ol><code>When to Seek Help?</code><ul><li>If you develop sudden weakness of limbs, loss of speech, unconsciousness or fall, control of your urine or stool, blurring of vision or blackout etc, you should immediately meet the doctor, preferably in the Emergency room.</li><li>If you have tingling or numbness following injury to head, neck or back or you get a sudden pain in the neck or back, it may be a serious condition that requires you to consult doctor immediately.</li><li>If you have tingling and numbness along with the manifestation of serious diseases like diabetes, you should be alarmed and consult the doctor.</li><li>You should also seek medical attention if you have attacks of tingling and numbness times and again, without obvious cause or you are not recovering completely.</li></ul><code>Treatment Options: </code><p>The likely cause of numbness or tingling primarily determines whether or not you need specific treatment, and if yes, which medicine, surgery or physical therapy to use. Some of the serious causes need immediate investigation and treatment through the emergency department while some are treated by regular outpatient follow up. You may be referred to specific specialists like neurologist or orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and definitive management.</p><p>However, there are certain things you may try yourself to reduce the symptoms of numbness and tingling. Those include:</p><ul><li>Loosening of any tight shoes or clothing</li><li>Avoiding lifting of heavy weight, poor posture or repetitive movements in order to avoid neck or back problems</li><li>Taking regular breaks at work, doing yoga and keeping good posture all the time</li><li>Shaking the limbs or moving toes or getting up if you are seating or leaning in the same position for a long time</li><li>Avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol</li><li>Stopping the medication causing numbness or tingling, if applicable</li><li>Control your diabetes with proper diet, exercise, medicine and regular follow up</li><li>Avoid being strict vegan, if possible. You need to take supplements as prescribed, if you have deficiency of Vitamin B 12</li><li>You may need to avoid certain risky activities like driving if you have bothersome numbness or tingling</li><li>Give importance to regular physiotherapy if your doctor has recommended it for your condition</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Related Topics: </code><p>Dizziness, Peripheral Neuropathy</p></ul> </div>"

It is caused by long standing &nbsp;exposure to irritant gas or particles most commonly by cigarette smoking. In developing countries indoor smoke exposure from firewood burning also is an important risk factor. </span></p><p>Chronic exposure to the irritant particles or gas causes chronic inflammation of the windpipe leading to narrowing of the windpipe that makes breathing &nbsp;harder for you. In addition to the narrowing of the windpipe the air sacs in the lungs are also damaged.</p><p>COPD is a preventable and treatable disease. It can cause significant limitation on daily activities and it increases the risk for heart disease, lung cancer, depression and infection. It is usually detected in people over 40 years of age and is more common with increasing age. Men are affected more than women. People with COPD can have severe worsening of symptoms periodically that might require acute treatment with antibiotics including hospitalization. Most of these acute worsening are caused by viral and bacterial infection. COPD cannot be cured but the symptoms can be controlled with &nbsp;treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><ul><li><span>Smoking is the most common cause of COPD. The lining of airways are inflamed and damaged by smoke.</span></li><li><span>Exposure to air pollutants like toxic fumes, gases, smoke etc can also increase the chance of developing COPD.</span></li><li><span>Indoor smoke exposure from firewood burning is an important cause of COPD in developing countries.</span></li><li><span>Rarely it can be hereditary. Deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-1 antitrypsin predisposes to COPD in younger patients who are less than 40 years old.</span></li><li><span>People who have never smoked can also develop COPD from yet unknown genetic causes.</span></li><li><span>Passive exposure to cigarette smoking &nbsp;can also increase the risk of COPD.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Only one third of people who smoke cigarette develop COPD. Symptoms do not develop until significant damage has been done to the windpipe and lungs. Shortness of breath and cough are two main symptoms of COPD.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Breathlessness: &nbsp;In early stages, shortness of breath develops only on moderate exertion. Later in the disease stage patients develop shortness of breath on minimal exertion and sometimes become short of breath at rest.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Cough: There may or may not be cough. When present, cough might be a dry cough or it could be productive of whitish color sputum. </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Others: Other nonspecific symptoms may occur like weight loss, fatigue,depression, bone loss, etc. But chest pain and blood in sputum are not commonly seen in COPD.</span></li><li><span>Acute flare up &nbsp;of COPD: Symptoms of COPD &nbsp;(shortness of breath and cough with sputum production) can intermittently worsen during the course of the disease. &nbsp;These episodes are usually caused by chest infections with bacteria and viruses. Cough and shortness of breath become more severe and distressing. Blood oxygen level may drop dangerously low, which could be fatal unless patient is connected to a breathing machine. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>COPD is diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms (dyspnea, cough}, exposure to risk factors (cigarette smoke, indoor and outdoor pollution) and an abnormal breathing test.</span></p><ul><li><span>Spirometry (A breathing test): It is the most commonly used test to diagnose COPD. This test estimates how much air you can blow out and how fast you can blow. If the test is &nbsp;abnormal, it is repeated again after inhaling a medicine. &nbsp;If the abnormality persists, then you will be diagnosed with COPD.</span></li><li><span>Others: Chest X-ray, CT, Blood tests to rule out other serious conditions like lung cancer, polycythemia etc.</span></li><li><span>Pulse oximetry: &nbsp;It is a device that measures heart rate and amount of oxygen in the blood. Lower levels are seen in exacerbation of COPD.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>Quitting smoking is the best way to treat COPD especially, when it is mild and early. To ease the symptoms, there are mainly four approaches to treatment of COPD:</span></p><ul><li><span>Medicines: There are various medicines used to treat COPD. </span><ul><li><span>Medications like albuterol, ipratropium, etc. are given in devices called inhalers. These help to open up the narrowed airways and decrease the swelling of airways. </span></li><li><span>A steroid inhaler like beclomethasone along with a bronchodilator inhaler is given in more severe COPD or regular flare-ups of symptoms.</span></li><li><span>Oral bronchodilator medicines like theophylline are also used.</span></li><li><span>Antibiotics are used when there is chest infection.</span></li><li><span>Medicines like morphine and codeine may be prescribed to reduce your coughing and difficulty in breathing.</span></li></ul></li><li><span>Oxygen: You will need oxygen when the disease becomes more severe.</span> <span>If your symptoms are very severe you may need to be admitted to hospital.</span></li><li><span>Chest physiotherapy can be started to help you clear secretions (mucus) from your chest by coughing, deep breathing exercises and suction machines.</span></li><li><span>Surgery: In rare cases, removal of the affected part of the lung can help reduce the symptoms.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span>Stopping smoking is the best way to prevent COPD and reduce the risk of flare ups. &nbsp;You need to receive vaccine against influenza virus and pneumococcus bacteria to prevent flu and other chest infections.</span></p><p><span>To prevent your disease from flaring up, you can do the following:</span></p><ul><li><span>Make a habit of &nbsp;exercising regularly, &nbsp;which helps to improve breathing, ease symptoms, and have a better quality of life.</span></li><li><span>Eat healthy and maintain weight.

There are many conditions that cause hyper or hypothyroidism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Hyperthyroidism</code><p>In this condition your thyroid gland is producing more thyroid hormone than your body needs. This will result in increased metabolic rate, increased cardiovascular activity, excessive heat production etc.The cells of thyroid gland increase in size and also change their structure. It is more common in women than men and prevalence is greater in old age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p>The common cause of hyperthyroidism are:</p><ul><li>Grave’s disease (overproduction of thyroid hormone because of immune system disorder).</li><li>Overactive thyroid nodules (lumps in the thyroid gland},</li><li>Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid},</li><li>Taking too much synthetic thyroid hormone.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are:</p><ul><li>Loss of weight</li><li>Frequent bowel movement</li><li>Intolerance to heat</li><li>Excessive sweating</li><li>Anxiety, nervousness and irritability</li><li>Fatigue, muscle weakness</li><li>Faster and irregular heartbeat</li><li>Swollen neck</li><li>Mood changes</li><li>Menstrual irregularity</li><li>Problem with sleeping</li><li>Thinning of skin</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Uncontrolled and untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications like arrhythmia, heart failure, weak bone and eye problems. Occasionally, symptoms may severely intensify in very short period (thyroid crisis) which could be life threatening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed based on the symptoms and high levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A high T3 or T4 and low TSH establishes the diagnosis of hyperthyroidisms. In order to identify the underlying causes your doctor will recommend an ultrasound of thyroid gland and few other blood tests looking for antibodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>There are different options available for treatment of hyperthyroidism. Depending on your situation your doctor will prescribe one or more of the following treatment modalities:</p><ul><li>Anti-thyroid medicines: Carbimazole, propylthiouracil. They block the formation of new thyroid hormones in thyroid gland.</li><li>Radioiodine therapy: You are given oral capsules or drinks that contain radioactive iodine. These iodines are taken up by the overactive thyroid gland and permanently destroy the thyroid gland. You will cured of hyperthyroidism but will develop hypothyroidism for which you will have to take supplemental thyroid hormone.</li><li>Thyroid surgery: Removal of part of your thyroid gland. You will need thyroid supplementation after removal of the thyroid.</li><li>Beta blocker are used to manage the heart rate.</li><li>Treatment of eye problems and other cardiac symptoms is also done accordingly.</li><li>You are asked to come for regular follow up.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Hypothyroidism</code><p>Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone to meet your body needs. This slows down all of your body’s activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><ul><li>Hashimoto’s disease- this is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed world. In this condition your immune system attacks your thyroid gland causing destruction of thyroid cells. As a result, thyroid gland cannot make enough thyroid hormone.</li><li>Iodine deficiency: This is more common in certain parts of world where salt is not iodized. It presents as enlargement of thyroid gland (goitre) and signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Eating iodized salt can prevent this form of hypothyroidism. However, taking too much iodine can cause hypothyroidism.</li><li>Treatment of hyperthyroidism with radioactive iodine or surgical removal of thyroid gland</li><li>Certain medication specially Lithium</li><li>Radiation therapy to the neck</li><li>Other : congenital hypothyroidism, diseases of pituitary gland that stimulates thyroid gland to produce hormones.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Symptoms develop gradually and become worse over months or years as the level of thyroxine in the body gradually falls. Some common symptoms of hypothyroidism are:</p><ul><li>Weight gain</li><li>Fatigue, decreased sweating</li><li>Joint, muscle pain</li><li>Heavy or irregular menstrual period</li><li>Depression</li><li>Slow heartbeat</li><li>Dry skin, hair</li><li>Cold intolerance</li><li>Constipation</li><li>Impaired memory</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poorly controlled or untreated hypothyroidism may lead to serious complications including heart problems, hypothyroid coma, infertility, peripheral neuropathy, mental health issues. etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Symptoms of hypothyroidism and low level of thyroid hormone in your blood makes the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>It is treated with medicine.

There are other types of cataract as well like those present at birth; those caused by injury to eye or complications of other eye conditions etc. These are however not as common as age related cataracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk Factors of Age Related Cataract</code><p>Most of the times there is not any clear cause of cataract but there are various factors that increase the risk of developing cataract:</p><ul><li>Older age</li><li>Smoking and alcohol consumption</li><li>Excessive sunlight and radiation exposure</li><li>Diabetes mellitus</li><li>Prolonged use of steroid medicines</li><li>Family history of cataract</li><li>Previous eye injury or inflammation</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms of Cataract</code><ul><li>Progressive decline in vision without pain</li><li>Have spots in your vision</li><li>Seeing halos around bright lights – for example, street lights.</li><li>Not being able to see in bright light or sunshine.</li><li>Problems with night driving, reading road signs, or difficulty reading fine letters</li><li>Often an increase in farsightedness</li><li>Problems in color vision</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>The doctor identifies cataract by examination of your eyes. Sometimes it is diagnosed during a routine eye check up even before having any symptoms.</p><ul><li>The doctor will conduct a detailed eye exam to check for the common causes of vision problems. It includes your ability to see near and distant objects, your ability to see things at center of focus and the ones at sides, the pressure inside your eyeball and any signs of nerve damage.</li><li>A dilated fundus examination may be performed to rule out other pathology that could account for diminished vision.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>Surgery as well as eye drops will be given by the doctor according to the condition of the cataract. &nbsp;During surgery the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. Surgery is indicated if the vision loss from the cataract is interfering&nbsp; with your work or daily activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>There is no proven therapy to prevent cataract. Some interventions may be&nbsp; helpful:</p><ul><li>Avoid or quit smoking</li><li>Eat a healthy balanced diet with a lot of fruits, vegetables, milk, fats and sodium.</li><li>Postmenopausal estrogen use</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

Without enough insulin, glucose in the blood doesn’t move into the cells depriving them of fuel for energy production. In the long run a persistently elevated blood sugar level causes harm to heart, kidney, nerves,>eyes,and legs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Types, Causes and Risk Factors</code><p>There are mainly two types of diabetes: Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes. There are also other special types of diabetes based on the causes of damage to the pancreas.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes also called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus occurs when pancreas produces little or no insulin. The cells in the pancreas that produce insulin are destroyed. Therefore, insulin is needed from the beginning to control blood sugar in type 1 DM. And as the cells producing insulin are destroyed this disease remains throughout your life with no complete cure till date. Type 1 DM appears earlier in life compared to type 2. Most commonly diagnosed in people less than 20 years old. It accounts for 10% of overall diabetes population.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or body becomes less sensitive to the insulin produced. The cells that produce insulin in pancreas are not destroyed and hence insulin is not required from the beginning to control blood sugar. It is commoner type of diabetes mellitus ( 90 % of all DM) and generally begins after age of 40. People with a family history of diabetes and who are overweight and obese may develop type 2 diabetes earlier. Since the cell producing insulin are intact, this type of DM can be managed with diet, weight reduction and exercise in the early stages. Subsequently they, need oral medication that stimulate insulin production from the pancreas. Over the years many people with type 2 diabetes need insulin from outside to keep blood sugar under control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Some common symptoms of diabetes mellitus are:</p><ul><li>Drinking water more than usual</li><li>Going to bathroom to urinate more often</li><li>Losing weight without effort</li><li>Feeling very hungry or tired</li><li>Cuts and wounds take longer time to heal</li><li>Having blurry vision</li><li>Tingling in your feet and hands</li><li>Sometimes an undiagnosed DM can present with complications called diabetic ketoacidosis where not only your blood sugars are high, you will be severely dehydrated, lethargic or sometimes comatose, kidney damage and life threatening acidosis.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Who is at risk for developing Diabetes Mellitus?</code><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Following conditions increase your risk of developing diabetes mellitus:</p><ul><li>Family history of diabetes in parents or siblings</li><li>Overweight and obesity</li><li>Age</li><li>Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise</li><li>Presence of other autoimmune diseases</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>High cholesterol and triglycerides level</li><li>Excessive alcohol consumption</li><li>Cigarette smoking</li><li>DM during pregnancy</li><li>Certain medication like steroids</li><li>Acute severe stress – these are usually transient</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eating high sugar diet doesn’t cause diabetes but it may unmask an underlying predisposition to develop diabetes. It will most likely make your diabetes control difficult if you already have diabetes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Diabetes is diagnosed by measuring blood glucose level. The best way to diagnose diabetes is to check a blood sugar level after 10-12 hours of not eating anything called fasting blood sugar level. Normally it should be between 70-100 mg/dl. If it is more than 126 mg/dl, it is called diabetes. If you are already experiencing symptoms of diabetes mentioned above, then a blood glucose level can be checked randomly without fasting. If it is higher than 200 mg/dl then a diagnosis of diabetes is made. Sometimes you may have all the risk factors for diabetes but your blood sugar level are within normal range. In these situation, you many undergo a test called glucose challenge test that will help in making a diagnosis of diabetes or a condition called impaired glucose tolerance also known as prediabetes. Another test that helps to make a diagnosis is called HBA1C. This test tells us about the your average blood sugar in last 3 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>You should always consult with your doctor about the treatment plan. Type I diabetes invariably requires insulin injections. . In case of type II diabetes, your doctor will ask you to control your blood sugar with modification of diet, and later give you some tablets to control your blood sugar level.</p><p>These are the common things you need to follow when you have diabetes:</p><ul><li>Healthy diet: Dietary control is the most important thing for a patient with diabetes. A sample of some best and worst food for diabetic patients includes.<ul><li>Avoid: white rice, fine white flour, white bread, regular jam, and food with added sugar, fatty food.</li><li>Best: Whole grain food, whole wheat, brown rice, food made with corn, vegetables, spinach, and fresh fruit.</li></ul></li><li>Exercise: Being physically active with regular exercise helps minimize cardiovascular risks.</li><li>Lose extra weight.</li><li>Limit your alcohol drinking.</li><li>Monitor your blood sugar regularly.</li><li>Take medicine, such as insulin injection or anti-diabetic tablets as your doctor has prescribed.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

      "body": "<div ><ul ><p><span>Esophageal varices &nbsp;are abnormally swollen veins in the lining of the lower esophagus.</span> <span>Most of the time, esophageal varices develop due to obstruction in the portal venous circulation (blood flow through the liver) but mainly it occurs when a healthy liver tissue is replaced by a scar tissue.</span></p><p><span>Due to the obstruction in portal vein, venous blood from abdominal organs and peripheral circulation cannot pass through the liver. As a result, a bypass circulation &nbsp;is created through other small blood vessels nearby. But due to the decreased capacity to handle the increased blood flow, gradually the small veins enlarge and swell. Eventually bleeding occurs due to decreased elasticity and increased pressure in the small parallel veins. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>Some of the causes for esophageal varices are listed below:</span></p><ul><li><em>Cirrhosis of liver:</em><span> In this condition, a healthy liver tissue is replaced by a scar tissue, which in turn blocks the circulation through the liver. Various diseases can cause cirrhosis such as viral infection of a liver, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver, cystic fibrosis and biliary atresia. Cirrhosis accounts for 40 percent probability for esophageal varices. </span></li><li><em>Thrombus formation:</em><span>&nbsp;Formation of thrombus (clot) in the portal vein can cause esophageal varices.</span></li><li><em>A parasitic infection:</em> Infections such as<b><span>&nbsp;Schistosomiasis can obstruct the portal vein leading to increase in pressure.</span></b></li><li><em>Budd-Chiari syndrome:</em> I<span>nterference</span> <span>with outflow of blood from liver due to formation of clot. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span>Esophageal varices may remain silent or present with bleeding. Person may have symptoms due to the underlying cause that is responsible for the varices. Common symptoms include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Vomiting blood or black tarry blood or blood in stool;</span></li><li><span>Lightheaded, dizzy;</span></li><li><span>Loss of consciousness;</span></li><li><span>Yellow eyes;</span></li><li><span>Swollen abdomen;</span></li><li><span>Pain abdomen.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment options</code><p>T<span>reatment for esophageal varices depends upon the underlying cause and symptoms for which the following investigations may be done:</span></p><ul><li><span>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate whether there is any evidence of bleeding, and help stop bleeding. </span></li><li>Ultrasound of liver, CT and MRI scans<span>&nbsp;to check liver structure and blood flow.</span></li><li>Blood tests t<span>o check liver function and cause of liver disease.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The main goal of treatment is to prevent esophageal varices from rupturing and bleeding. Bleeding mainly can be prevented by minimizing the pressure in the portal veins. Following treatment options should be followed in case of esophageal varices:</span></p><ul><li><span>As there is increased pressure in the portal veins so beta-blockers such as propanolol should be given to minimize the pressure.</span></li><li><span>The dilated veins need to be compressed, therefore a medication is injected into the swollen veins.</span></li><li><span>In order to prevent bleeding from the varices, the dilated veins are tightly tied off with the help of endoscope.</span></li><li><span>As there is increased chance of bleeding from varices, patient should be closely monitored for the sign and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock such as cold clammy skin, tachycardia, a drop in blood pressure, decreased urine output, restlessness, and weak peripheral pulses. </span></li><li><span>If bleeding occurs and is present in vomit and stool, our major concern should be to stop bleeding as quick as possible.</span></li><li><span>Intravenous fluids should be started to restore the lost fluid volume and correct the electrolyte imbalance.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Blood Transfusion may be required.</span></li><li><span>In order to reduce the pressure in the swollen veins, a drug called octreotide is administered which works by reducing the blood flow.</span></li><li><span>Bleeding can be stopped from the varices by reducing the pressure in the portal vein which can be done by placing a stent in the liver through a catheter. The stent connects hepatic vein with the portal vein which provides extra pathway to carry blood to the heart. This procedure is called </span>Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS).</li><li><span>If all other&nbsp;options fail or are not viable, the patient should be considered&nbsp;for a liver transplant.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek a medical help</code><p><span>Bleeding from esophageal varices is an emergency condition and can be fatal if not managed on time. Patients can lose massive amounts of blood in a short time. One should visit a doctor if following features may present:</span></p><ul><li><span>Shock features like cold and clammy skin, perspiration, fast and feeble heart rate, decreased urine output, restlessness.</span></li><li><span>Feeling dizzy, light headed.</span></li><li><span> If blood is present in your vomitus or stool, you should always go for a treatment urgently.</span></li><li><span> If your skin and eyes become yellow.</span></li><li><span>If you have distended abdomen with or without pain, and &nbsp;swollen legs.</span></li><li><span>Change in mental status or confusion.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span>Esophageal varices is prevented by preventing a liver disease. You can follow these guidelines to help prevent this condition:</span></p><ul><li><span>Avoid drinking excess alcohol.</span></li><li><span>If you already have liver disease, stop alcohol completely.</span></li><li><span>Do not use illegal intravenous drugs.</span></li><li><span>Get checked if you have yellow eyes.</span></li><li><span>If you have cirrhosis of liver, get Endoscopy to check for varices.</span></li><li><span>Get vaccinated against Hepatitis B and if necessary against A.</span></li><li><span>Avoid unnecessary medication.</span></li><li><span>Regular blood tests to check liver function if you are taking medicine that can harm liver.</span></li></ul></ul></div>"

The thick membrane is &nbsp;the hallmark of diphtheria infection. The bacteria also produces toxins that may affect heart, nerves and kidneys. </span></p><p>Diphtheria is rare in developed countries but still common in developing countries, although number of cases has declined significantly as a result of childhood vaccination. It can be deadly in children younger than 15 years. Up to 3-10% of people who get diphtheria die from it.</p><p><span >Diphtheria spreads from a person to person through inhalation of &nbsp;droplets released during coughing and sneezing by an infected person. The duration between exposure and occurrence of symptoms is 2 to 5 days. An infected person can transmit the infection to others for up to six weeks after the initial infection. Very rarely, diphtheria is also spread through handling of infected persons belongings that are infected with the bacteria. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p><span >Certain factors increase the chance of getting the infection:</span></p><ul><li ><span >People with poor hygiene and living &nbsp;in poor sanitary conditions.</span></li><li ><span >Lack of up-to-date vaccination in children and adults (lack of booster).</span></li><li ><span >Travelling to endemic areas.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span >Not everyone exposed to disease experiences symptoms although they can still spread the disease to others. The early symptoms may be similar to common cold, such as sore throat. Once the infection is established, patient will develop fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and experience difficulty breathing and swallowing. On examination, a thick covering of secretion called pseudomembrane is seen in the nose, throat and airways. It bleeds on scraping. If pseudomembrane formation is extensive, patient can suffocate and die from respiratory arrest. &nbsp;The bacteria also produces toxins that is absorbed in the blood and affects heart, potentially causing a heart failure and death. Toxins can also cause paralysis and kidney failure. &nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek medical care</code><p><span >Diphtheria can be a serious disease.

Your doctor will review your &nbsp;history and conduct a physical examination. The presence of gray coating on the throat or nostrils strongly suggests diphtheria. Diagnostic tests are performed to confirm diagnosis. These tests include:</span></p><ul><li ><span >Culture of sample from throat and skin lesion: &nbsp;to look for the bacteria that causes diphtheria.</span></li><li ><span >Toxigenicity test: &nbsp;to&nbsp;help differentiate toxin producing bacteria from one that is non toxin producing.</span></li><li ><span >Other tests: Blood tests may show increased white blood cells and urine may show protein.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span >Once diphtheria is suspected based on clinical finding, appropriate samples are collected and treatment started immediately. Infected person is kept in isolation until considered noninfectious.&nbsp;</span><span >Treatment consists of:</span></p><ul><li ><span >Antitoxin: Antitoxin binds and &nbsp;neutralizes the effects of toxin produced by the bacteria.</span></li><li ><span >Antibiotics: Antibiotics like erythromycin, penicillin are used &nbsp;to kill the bacteria, so that no more toxin is produced and disease spread is prevented. </span></li><li ><span >Supportive care: &nbsp;Monitoring for airway, nervous system &nbsp;and heart function, and treatment if any complications develop.</span></li><li ><span >Close contact of a diphtheria case should be identified and considered for antibiotic prophylaxis.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span >Diphtheria can be prevented with vaccines given per national guidelines. Some governments and health systems may provide&nbsp;a pentavalent vaccine that include DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine along with Hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae Type B vaccines. The vaccine should be administered at 6</span><span >th</span><span >, 10</span><span >th</span><span > and 14</span><span >th</span><span > weeks of birth and booster dose of DPT at 18</span><span >th</span><span > month.

The longer that plaque on the teeth, the bacteria causes inflammation of the gums that is called Gingivitis. In gingivitis the gum becomes red, swollen and can easily bleed.</p><p>Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease that can usually be reversed with daily brushing, flossing and regular dental cleaning by dentist or dental hygienist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Periodontitis</code><p>Periodontitis is inflammation around the teeth. When gingivitis not treated it can advance to periodontitis. It is characterized by gingival inflammation accompanied by loss of supportive connective tissues including alveolar bones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk Factors</code><ul><li>Smoking : Smoking is the most significant risk factor of gum disease. Smoking also lowers the chances of successful treatment</li><li>Diabetes: People of diabetes are higher risk of developing gum disease</li><li>Hormonal change (Pregnancy gingivitis): Hormonal shifts during pregnancy causes gingival overgrowth and inflammation. The pregnancy related gingivitis may not be associated with dental plaque and usually doesn’t involve the periodontal space</li><li>Vitamin C deficiency: Gingival disease caused by Vitamin C deficiency is called Scurvy. The gingival component of Scurvy is sometime difficult to distinguish from bacterial gingivitis. However Scurvy is associated with other systemic symptoms like petechial rashes, ecchymosis, coiled hair and hyperkeratosis</li><li>Medications: Certain medications may cause gingival overgrowth which makes it difficult to keep gum and teeth clean. Common drugs are – antiepileptic (phenytoin}, antihypertensives (Calcium Channel blockers – amlodipine, diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine) and anti neoplastic (Cyclosporine)</li><li>Systemic disease: Systemic disease like HIV, Leukemia or some genetic disorder like Down syndrome puts at high risk for developing periodontal disease</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><ul><li>Bad breath that doesn’t go away easily</li><li>Red or swollen gums</li><li>Tender gums which bleed easily even with brushing and flossing</li><li>Painful chewing</li><li>Sensitive and loose teeth</li><li>Receding gums</li><li>Pus may be seen coming from the infected pockets</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>You should see your dentist if you have any of the above mentioned symptoms. The doctor will take a detailed history to identify the risk factors or underlying conditions causing the disease. He will examine your mouth to look for any signs of inflammation and also check for the infected pockets. You will also be asked to have an X-ray to see for any bone loss. You will be referred to a periodontist if you have periodontitis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>The main goal of treatment is to control infection.

Heart attack occurs when the blood flow to the heart is &nbsp;severely reduced or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs regular supply of blood and oxygen to survive. If the blood flow to the heart is not restored quickly, muscle tissues begin to die. </span></p><p><span>The main cause of the blockage is the built-up of fat in the walls of blood vessels. These areas of fat accumulation are called </span><i><span>plaques</span></i><span>. Mostly of the time, &nbsp;these plaques grow slowly as they accumulate fat from the blood. Occasionally, these plaque rupture abruptly and a blood clot is formed rapidly within the vessel that completely blocks the blood flow to an area of the heart. If the blockage is released early by giving clot busting medications, the heart muscles in that area of heart can be rescued before they die permanently. If a large area of heart muscles dies, it can seriously put your life in danger. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p><span>Conditions that increase the chances of plaque formation in the blood vessels are the biggest risk factor for an heart attack. Some of these conditions you can change, some you cannot. The situation that you cannot change but increase your risk of heart attack are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Age: As you get older, your risk of a heart attack goes up.&nbsp;More than 80% of people who die of heart disease are 65 or older.</span></li><li><span>Sex: Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. However, older women who have a heart attack are more likely to die earlier than older men with heart attacks.</span></li><li><span>Family history: </span><span>If you have a close relative who developed heart disease prematurely—before 55 for men and 65 for women—you have higher chances of getting it.</span></li><li><span>Ethnicity: Compared to whites, &nbsp;African-Americans, Mexican, Indians, and some Asian Americans have higher risk of heart disease. But this may be related to higher prevalence of other risk factors.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>However, many risk factors of heart attacks are preventable and you can lower your risk of heart attack. These include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Smoking: Your heart attack risk is two to four times higher if you smoke cigarettes.&nbsp;Smoking damages the arteries, contributes to high cholesterol and high blood pressure and raises the risk of blood clots. </span></li><li><span>High Cholesterol: If your&nbsp;</span><span>total cholesterol</span><span> and particularly LDL cholesterol</span><span>&nbsp;is high, your risk of heart disease and thus heart attack increases.</span></li><li><span>High Blood Pressure: It is a common problem in adults, which makes your heart work harder to pump blood. It increases your risk of&nbsp;</span><span>stroke</span><span>, heart attack, kidney failure, and&nbsp;</span><span>heart failure</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Diabetes mellitus: If you have diabetes, particularly uncontrolled diabetes, your chances of having heart attack and dying from it is increased.</span></li><li><span>Obesity: </span><span>People who have excess body fat — especially around the midsection — are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke even if they have no other risk factors.</span></li><li><span>Sedentary lifestyle: If </span><span>you do not exercise at least&nbsp;</span><span>30 minutes </span><span>most days of the week, your chances of having heart attack will be more.</span></li></ul><p><span>You can have heart attack by mechanism other than that related to plaque formation and rupture. &nbsp;Cocaine abuse causes spasm of the coronary arteries, which then&nbsp;causes a heart attack. Certain autoimmune diseases with high level of inflammation can also cause heart attack at younger age.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Signs and Symptoms</code><p><span> Some common signs and symptoms of heart attack: </span></p><ul><li><span>Chest discomfort is the most common symptom of a heart attack. The discomfort may feel like a pressure, tightness, squeezing sensation on the left side the chest that may spread to the neck, jaw and left arm. &nbsp;The pain might be intermittent lasting &nbsp;few minutes or continue for longer period depending on the degree of blood flow blockage and muscle death. People with diabetes can have a heart attack without chest pain as the nerves supplying the heart are damaged in diabetes. </span></li><li><span>Cold Sweat: Sudden excessive&nbsp;sweating is another symptom of heart attack.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shortness of breath: fluid start to build up in your lungs after a heart attack and cause difficulty in breathing. </span></li><li><span>Sudden dizziness: due to weak heart unable to pump enough blood to the brain.</span></li><li><span>Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion: sometimes a heart attack can masquerade as upset stomach with nausea and vomiting. </span></li><li><span>Cardiac arrest: A massive heart attack can completely stop your heart from beating. Most of the patient with cardiac arrest from a heart attack do not survive. </span></li></ul><p><span>A heart attack can come suddenly without any warning and cause cardiovascular collapse. More commonly, you will experience warning signs for days and weeks ahead. These warning signs include recurrent chest pain that comes on more frequently and with increasing intensity either on exertion or at rest. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span>All severe chest pain are not from a heart attack. If you have severe chest pain, your doctor will order some blood tests to see if it is coming from your heart. Along with the blood test, you will need an ECG and echocardiogram. A final diagnosis of a heart attack from fat accumulation is made by coronary angiogram. During coronary angiogram, your doctor will inject a dye in the arteries of the heart via a long catheter inserted into your groin. Then your doctor will take x-ray of your heart that shows the blocked artery. If your doctor finds a blockage during angiography they can place a stent to open up the blockage. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>If you think you might be experiencing a heart attack you should seek medical help immediately and go to the emergency department of a local hospital. Your chance of survival depends on how quickly you reach hospital and receive clot removing treatments. If you reach hospital within 4- 6 hours of onset of symptoms, doctors can save your heart by giving a clot busting medicine through your vein or by placing a stent in the blocked artery. Sometimes you will need an emergent surgery to bypass the area of the blockage. If the heart attack is massive, your heart will fail to pump blood and fluid will build up in your lungs. You will need respirator to help you breath and medications to increase your blood pressure. </span><span>&nbsp;After you recover from an heart attack, your heart function might return back to normal or you will develop a weak heart called heart failure. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>There are several health behaviors that you can adopt to minimize the chances of getting a heart attack. Some of these include:</p><ul><li><span>Healthy lifestyle: Following a healthy lifestyle is very important to prevent heart attack. Exercising regularly and following a healthy diet, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods is important. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Maintain a healthy weight.</span></li><li><span>Certain types of health conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes make a heart attack more likely to occur. So controlling and managing such conditions can help lower the chances of getting a&nbsp;heart attack. &nbsp;Take all prescribed medicines regularly.</span></li><li>Quite smoking.</li><li>See your doctor for regular checkups.</li></ul></ul></div>"

Although it is a chronic condition, it is possible for you to lead an active life if treatment is initiated on time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span >Heart failure is caused by diseases that damage or weaken the heart. Conditions that may cause heart failure include:</span></p><ul><li ><span >High blood pressure: The heart must pump hard and thus over a period of time heart muscles get enlarged and get stiff and &nbsp;do not work properly. </span></li><li ><span >Coronary heart disease: These diseases cause narrowing of blood vessels, reducing the blood flow to heart muscles and thus making them weak and unable to function well.</span></li><li ><span >Diseases of heart valve: The valves may be narrowed or leaky interfering the normal blood flow and pressure through the valves. If not corrected, this also makes the heart weak over time.</span></li><li ><span >Cardiomyopathy: Damage to heart muscles from various causes make the heart weak. Heavy alcohol intake, drugs like cocaine, chemotherapy and acute viral infections can directly affect the heart muscle.</span></li><li ><span >Congenital heart diseases: a heart that is not developed properly is likely to fail sooner. </span></li><li ><span >Arrhythmias weakens the heart over time . </span></li><li ><span >Diseases that cause the lining of the heart (called pericardium) to get too thick and cause a heart failure. TB and cancer can cause constrictive pericarditis.</span></li><li ><span >Conditions such as thyroid disease, severe anemia, diabetes mellitus can also cause a heart failure. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p><span >The symptoms of heart failure are:</span></p><ul><li ><span >Shortness of breath: most common during &nbsp;exertion or on lying flat.</span></li><li ><span >Reduced exercise capacity.</span></li><li ><span >Swelling of lower limbs and abdomen. </span></li><li ><span >Chest pain.</span></li><li ><span >Feeling of own heart beat (palpitation).</span></li><li ><span >Dizziness.</span></li><li ><span >Fatigue and tiredness.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p><span >Heart failure is diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms discussed above and an echocardiogram showing either low ejection fraction or a stiff heart. If you experience the above symptoms, you should see your doctor. The doctor will find out the severity as well as the causes of the heart failure through a review of your symptoms and medical history, and a&nbsp;detailed examination. You will also send you for some of these diagnostic tests:</span></p><ul><li ><span >Electrocardiogram (ECG): This will trace the heart’s activity and may detect conditions, such as an abnormal heart rhythm or a previous heart attack that could cause heart failure.</span></li><li ><span >Echocardiography: An echocardiogram of your heart can measure the weakness of your heart by measuring something called <em>ejection fraction</em> (EF). &nbsp;An EF of more than 50% is considered normal. Similarly, echocardiogram can also measure the stiffness of your heart. Hence, echocardiogram is essential to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure.</span></li><li ><span >Blood tests: Natriuretic peptide is protein measured in the blood that gives &nbsp;a measure of extra fluid in your body which happens when you have heart failure. </span></li><li ><span >Imaging: Chest X-ray to detect the size and shape of heart; CT scan, MRI may be needed in some cases.</span></li><li ><span >Coronary angiogram: often needed to rule out underlying coronary artery disease which is the most common cause of heart failure.</span></li><li ><span >Other tests: Exercise stress test, urine tests, and other blood tests to rule out other possible disease conditions.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span >Management of heart failure involves relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life by using long-term medications. Most of the time, it is a chronic condition that you will have to live with. Occasionally, it can be &nbsp;completely corrected by treating the underlying disease. Below are some of the treatment options:</span></p><p><em><span >Lifestyle modification:</span></em></p><ul><li ><span >Stop smoking and drink in moderation.</span></li><li ><span >Decrease salt and water intake (less than 2 litres of fluid in a day in severe cases).</span></li><li ><span >Maintain a healthy weight.</span></li><li ><span >Indulge into light activity and safe exercises.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Medicines:</em></p><p>Medicines are given for symptomatic relief according to the cause and severity of the condition. They should be taken on time every day. Some of the medicines used are:</p><ul><li ><span >Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors like enalapril, lisinopril etc: These medicines prevent a buildup of fluid, have a protective effect on the heart, and may slow down the progression of heart failure.</span></li><li ><span >Beta blockers e.g. metoprolol, atenolol etc : These can slow the heart rate and decrease blood pressure and help prolong life.</span></li><li ><span >Diuretics: These reduce fluid retention.</span></li><li ><span >Mineralocorticoids like spironolactone etc: These also reduce fluid retention.</span></li><li ><span >Other medicines: nitrates, digoxin etc.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Surgery and medical device</em>:</p><ul><li ><span >Surgery such as&nbsp;heart valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or both can correct the underlying disease and cure heart failure. </span></li><li ><span >There are medical devices that can help your heart pump efficiently until you get a heart transplant.</span></li><li ><span >You can also implant a defibrillator in the chest that will start your heart in case it stops.</span></li><li ><span >Your heart rate can be artificially controlled by pacemakers.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p><span >Healthy lifestyle, regular health checkup and screening for cardiovascular problems are some of the ways you can prevent a heart failure.&nbsp;</span></p></ul></div>"

Your body makes some amount of cholesterol and the rest comes from the food you eat, mainly the animal products (plants do not contain cholesterol). Some amount of cholesterol is needed to build healthy cells but having high levels of cholesterol can increase the risk of heart disease.</p><p>Cholesterol is carried in the blood by&nbsp;special proteins called <em>lipoproteins</em>. Lipoproteins are really what are measured to find out how much cholesterol is present in the blood. &nbsp;There are mainly two types of lipoproteins that are related to cardiovascular health:</p><ul><li>Low -density Lipoproteins (LDL) or “bad” cholesterols;</li><li>High- density Lipoproteins (HDL) or “good” cholesterol.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you have a high amount of bad cholesterol (LDL) circulating in your blood, it gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. These deposits narrow the blood vessels and make it difficult for enough blood to flow through your arteries. When the narrowing becomes severe, not enough oxygen reaches your heart and brain which can lead to a heart attack or&nbsp;stroke. So high levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) is bad for your health.</p><p>Good cholesterol (HDL) does exactly opposite of&nbsp;the bad cholesterol. It removes fat from the deposits in the&nbsp;blood vessel and delivers to the liver and other organs where it is metabolized to less harmful elements. Therefore, a high level of good cholesterol (HDL) is good for your health.</p><p>Triglycerides are the other type of fat (lipid) found in the blood. High triglycerides contribute to the hardening and thickening of arterial wall (atherosclerosis}, which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Extremely high levels of triglycerides can also cause inflammation of the pancreas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p>These are the risk factors which may increase the level of bad cholesterol in your body:</p><ul><li><em>Dietary habit:</em> Eating food that are high in cholesterol like red meat or whole milk dairy products.</li><li><em>Smoking:</em> Smoking damages the blood vessel where fatty deposits accumulate and makes the blood vessel narrowed. Smoking also lowers your HDL (good cholesterol).</li><li><em>Sedentary lifestyle:</em> Regular exercise helps to increase HDL (good cholesterol) but lack of exercise does the opposite and increases the LDL (bad cholesterol).</li><li><em>Obesity:</em> Large waist circumference increases the risk of high cholesterol.</li><li><em>Diabetes:</em> Having high blood sugar may contribute to increasing LDL (bad cholesterol) and decreasing HDL (good cholesterol).</li><li><em>Excessive alcohol consumption:</em> Increases triglyceride level in the blood.</li><li><em>Genetic:</em> Having family history of&nbsp;high cholesterol may increase the risk.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>High cholesterol level does not exhibit&nbsp;any symptoms on its own. So you may not even know you have a high LDL or triglyceride levels. &nbsp;But having&nbsp;high cholesterol levels increases your risk of&nbsp;having heart attack or&nbsp;stroke.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Increased cholesterol levels is often identified during routine screening of cardiovascular problems. If you have any symptoms of heart disease, diabetes or&nbsp;kidney disorders, you should regularly check your cholesterol levels. Your doctor will usually check for triglyceride levels as part of the cholesterol test (also called the Lipid panel or Lipid profile). You will have to fast for 9-12 hours before giving the blood sample.</p><p>Your doctor will measure your blood pressure, weight and make an assessment of your risk of developing cardiovascular problems as well based on your history, physical examination and laboratory findings. You may be referred to a&nbsp;dietitian or an exercise program, as appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>Based on the levels of cholesterol in your body and other factors that might increase the risk of a heart disease, the specific treatment may vary. However, there are two approaches two treating high cholesterol:</p><p><em>Lifestyle modification: </em></p><p>Regardless of the treatment provided, lifestyle modification is always essential to keep a healthy balance of cholesterol in body.</p><ul><li>Stop smoking and reduce the amount of alcohol you drink</li><li>Diet: eat high fiber diet like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Limit total amount of meat, egg yolks. choose fish and poultry more often than red meat</li><li>Engage in regular physical activity which increases good cholesterol</li><li>Maintain healthy weight</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Medications:</em></p><p>The specific choice of medication depends on various factors including your individual risk factors, age, current health and possible side effects. Statins, Bile salt binding resins, Fibrate, Niacin and omega fatty acids supplements are some of the common choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>Adapting a healthy lifestyle such as eating a healthy diet and daily exercise, regular health check up with cardiovascular screening, complying with the treatment regimen and regular follow up are some of the&nbsp;ways to prevent and control high cholesterol in your body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>"

It is an warning sign that needs an urgent response as it can quickly develop into a full-blown stroke.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the &nbsp;symptoms of stroke?</code><p><span>Patients with stroke often do not seek medical help on their own, because they may not be in pain or they may not be able to appreciate that something has gone wrong. Often, a family member or an accompanying person is the first to notice the symptoms. The patient may suffer from variety of symptoms such as:</span></p><ul><li><span>a slurred speech or difficulty speaking;</span></li><li><span>inability to move certain parts of the body;</span></li><li><span> numbness of the face, arm or leg;</span></li><li><span>drooping of one side of the mouth;</span></li><li><span>difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;</span></li><li><span>headache;</span></li><li><span>difficulty walking and balancing;</span></li><li><span>dizziness, fainting;</span></li><li><span>patients may lose consciousness if the stroke is massive. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the different types of stroke?</code><p><span>There are two types of stroke: </span></p><ul><li><span><em>Ischemic:</em> Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain. The clot may be formed within the blood vessels of the brain or the clot can form outside the brain, mainly in the heart and large vessels, that is swept through the circulation to the brain. About 85% of all strokes are ischemic stroke. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span><em> Hemorrhagic.</em> In hemorrhagic stroke, blood vessels in the brain rupture and bleed into the brain tissue causing death of the brain cells. Poorly-controlled hypertension and a brain aneurysm (ballooning of the blood vessel secondary to a defect in the wall of the blood vessel that makes it weak and prone to rupture) are two most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke. Other causes of hemorrhagic stroke are overtreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants) and blood disorder that causes low platelets. Hemorrhagic stroke can be further divided into <em>intraparenchymal bleed</em> and <em>subarachnoid bleed,</em> which are treated differently and have different prognosis. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>What are the risk factors for stroke?</code><p><span>The risk factors that increase your risk of stroke are similar to the risk factors that increase your risk of a heart attack. These risk factors can be divided into modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. &nbsp;By controlling the modifiable risk factors, up to 50% of stroke can be prevented. </span></p><ul><li><span>Modifiable risk factors: </span><ul><li><span>Lifestyle factors: Overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, heavy drinking and use of illicit drugs like cocaine and amphetamine, cigarette smoking.</span></li><li><span>Medical risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><span>Non modifiable risk factors: </span><ul><li><span>Old age &gt; 55 years;</span></li><li><span>men are at higher risk than women;</span></li><li><span>family history of stroke, TIA or heart attacks;</span></li><li><span>African americans have higher risk of stroke compared to&nbsp;other races.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How is stroke diagnosed?</code><p><span>Stroke is diagnosed based on the presence of one of the symptoms discussed above and physical examination demonstrating a weakness on some part of the body. To confirm the diagnosis, the type of stroke is identified and other conditions that may mimic a stroke (e.g. brain tumor) are ruled out. Your doctor will order a CT scan or an MRI of the brain or a cerebral angiogram. &nbsp;Your doctor will also order some of the following&nbsp;tests to identify the underlying cause of the stroke:</span></p><ul><li><span> Blood tests to evaluate blood glucose, lipid profile, coagulation profile and various other tests.</span></li><li><span>Carotid ultrasound &nbsp;to assess large blood vessels in your neck.</span></li><li><span>Echocardiography &nbsp;to assess your heart.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>How do you treat stroke?</code><p><span>Management of stroke depends on the types of stroke. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Treatment of ischemic stroke is aimed towards quickly restoring the blood flow to the brain. This is achieved by injecting “clot busting” medicines into the vein if you reach hospital within 4-6 hours of onset of symptoms. If more time has elapsed since, &nbsp;your chance of full recovery will be dramatically reduced. You will be given aspirin to reduce further risk of stroke. Doctors may recommend&nbsp;other procedures such as,&nbsp;carotid endarterectomy, balloon angioplasty and stent placements to open the narrowed arteries with the aim of reducing your risk of future strokes. </span></p><p><span>Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke focuses on control of the bleeding and decreasing pressure from building up inside the brain. Drugs to lower the pressure are given to prevent further bleeding. If the area bleeding is large, surgery may be performed in the brain itself to remove the blood and relieve pressure. If the bleeding is from an aneurysm, surgery is performed to remove the aneurysm. In subarachnoid bleeding, a medicine called nimodipine is given to prevent further spasm of the blood vessels. </span></p><p><span> As mentioned above,&nbsp;if you experience a “mini-stroke” &nbsp;you need to seek urgent medical care.</span></p><p><span>Rehabilitation and physical therapy is an integral part of stroke care. Patients with stroke often have problem with breathing, swallowing, balancing and vision. A rigorous rehabilitation can lead to significant regaining of strength and recovery of functions. Stroke rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary approach consisting of a neurologist, nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist, speech therapist and a psychologist or a psychiatrist. </span></p></ul> </div>"

There are four sinuses and are located around the nasal passages. These cavities communicate with the nasal passage via four narrow openings. &nbsp;These openings drain the mucus secreted in the sinuses which are normally filled with air. &nbsp;When these opening are blocked, sinuses gets filled up with mucus and debris which subsequently gets infected with microorganisms and cause sinusitis. </span></p><p><span>Most of the time the inflammation is caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection and resolves within 3-4 weeks. &nbsp;It is called acute sinusitis.

Most of the time, no further testing or imaging is required. In complicated and refractory cases, your doctor may send you for an allergy testing, or perform nasal endoscopy, bacterial and fungal culture of the nasal secretion, or order a CT scan of your sinuses.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p>Treatment of sinusitis depends on whether the infection is acute or chronic:</p><p><em><b>Acute sinusitis</b></em><span><em>:</em> Most patients with acute sinusitis improve without antibiotic therapy. If the symptoms are mild to moderate and of less than 10 days in duration, therapy is aimed at facilitating the drainage of the blocked sinuses by the use of nasal decongestants, nasal flush with normal saline and nasal steroids. A vaporizer or steam inhalation may also help in draining the blocked sinuses. Warm compresses are useful to relieve pain in the nose and sinuses. Saline nose drops are also safe for home use. </span></p><p><span>Use of nonprescription decongestant nasal drops or sprays are effective in controlling symptoms. However, they should not be used beyond their recommended duration of use. &nbsp;If the patients do not improve after 10 days or if they are suffering from severe symptoms, antibiotic therapy is recommended. Antibiotics are typically given for a period of 10 to 14 days. Pain killers can be used to control headaches. </span></p><p><em><b>Chronic sinusitis: </b></em><span>&nbsp;In chronic sinusitis, the treatment is guided towards control of underlying condition which is most likely an allergy. Avoidance of allergens, chronic treatment with antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment options. Sometimes immunotherapy (allergy shots) is required to control allergy. Surgery can be done to correct a deviated septum or&nbsp;remove nasal polyps.</span></p></ul> </div>"

      "body": "<div> <ul> <code>Introduction :</code><p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder. Schizophrenic people often hear voices which aren’t there and may see the scene which isn’t real. They may feel other people are trying to hurt them. Actually, the word schizophrenia is comprised of two Greek words- skhizein meaning to split and phren meaning mind. Though the whole literary meaning of the word directs towards splitted mind, but schizophrenia isn’t considered as split personality or multiple personality. The schizophrenic patient also having the problem of multiple personality is rarely noticed which is known as complicated schizophrenia.</p><p>Schizophrenia most commonly starts at the age of 13-30. Male may develop the symptoms earlier than Female. This type of mental problem rarely occurs after 30 and people usually do not develop the schizophrenia after the age of 45. It is believed that 1 percent of the total population is suffered from this mental disease. Some research shows it is the result of faulty neuronal development in the brain of the fetus.</p><p><span><strong>Symptoms :</strong></span></p><p>Symptoms of schizophrenia may be classified into three categories:</p><ol><li>Pshychotic symptoms : a person is distorted to hallucinations- hearing or seeing things that are not there, delusions- beliefs that are not true and trouble organizing thoughts and movements.</li><li>Negative symptoms : a person becomes weak to react normally showing emotions, facial expressions and motivations.</li><li>Cognitive symptoms : a person will gradually become withdrawn. The process of thinking will be depressed and unble to concentrate resulting the person in problem to calculate the information to make any decision.</li></ol><code>Factors influencing Schizophrenia :</code><p>Experts believe several factors are responsible to the onset of schizophrenia but no one is sure. They think the genes, the environment and the brain chemistry may play the vital role. Many evidences suggest that genetic and environmental factors act together to bring about schizophrenia. Here, for the convenience, it is listed one by one as below –</p><ol><li>Genetic inheritance : If a family member had the problem of schizophrenia then there is more chance to inherit it genetically.</li><li>Chemical imbalance in the brain : It is believed that people with schizophrenia has the imbalance of brain chemicals, viz. dopamin, glutamate and serotonin.</li><li>Family relationships : If there is not good relationship among family members then it is more likely to develop schizophrenia.</li><li>Environmental factors : It may be triggered by environmental viral infection or immune disorder.</li><li>Misuse of drugs : Misuse of drugs or use of substance will also trigger the schizophrenia.</li></ol><code>Diagnosis and Tests :</code><p>The present method of differential diagnosis of schizophrenia rely on the symptoms and signs shown by the victims. By ruling out other mental disorders and making sure the symptoms are not due to abuse of drugs, medication or a medical condition, doctors do the following exams :</p><ul><li>Physical exam – knowing the whole history and behavioral activities of the patient. If it proves the patient has hallucination, delusion, disorganized speech and catatonic behavior, then it is 70% confirmed that he or she has the problem of schizophrenia.</li><li>Screening tests – doctors may observe MRI or CT scan.</li><li>Psychiatric evaluation- doctor may check the mental status of the patient by observing appearance and demeanor and asking about suicidal thoughts. This may also include the discussion of family and personal history.</li></ul><code>Treatments and Therapies :</code><p>Since the cause of schizophrenia is still unclear, treatments focus on eliminating the symptoms of the disease. This include :</p><ul><li>Antipsychotic medication – there are lots of medicines to diminish the symptoms of schizophrenia which is usually given on daily basis in pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotics are given by injections once or twice a month. Side effects may arise in the beginning of medication period which go away after a few days. There are two major types of antipsychotic medication, viz. typical or conventional and atypical or new generation. Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine etc belong under typical and clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone etc belong under the category of atypical psychotic medication.</li><li>Recovery and rehabilitation – while there is no any proper medication for schizophrenia it is more emphasized in proper rehabilitation of the patient.</li><li>Psychosocial treatments – after the patient is recovering nicely the psychosocial treatments are also carried out such as attending school or work. Such treatment strengthens their will power and are less likely to have relapses.</li><li>Yoga and meditation – now-a-days yoga and meditation are also used side by side to cure psychotic diseases. This helps them to develop concentration.</li></ul> </ul> </div>"

The risk increases in those having a poor immune system (such as from HIV/AIDS, cancer,diabetes, or certain medications) and in athletes involved in contact sports, such as wrestling. Sweating in tight clothing provides a favourable environment for the fungal growth.</p><p>Ringworm spreads through contact. Here are a few possible contact options:</p><ul><li>Human to human contact: by direct contact with the lesions of an infected person.</li><li>Animal to human: by touching an animal with ringworm. Ringworm can spread while petting or grooming dogs or cats.</li><li>Soil to human: The spores may also be present in the soil and may infect susceptible persons or animals.</li><li>Objects to human: It is also spread through sharing bedding, towels, shaving instruments, manicure instruments or clothing.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>Symptoms depend upon the area affected. The affected skin would have itchy pink rash, scales and crust and the border may be covered with blisters. If the scalp is affected, there would be round patches of hair loss, area of scalp with very brittle hair which is easily pulled out and underlying skin looks pink and swollen along with dry crusty scalp look like dandruff. Similarly if the foot is infected, there would be itchy, burning red scaly cracked skin between the toes which may have unpleasant odor. Whereas fungal infection of the toe and fingernails shows whitish, brownish and yellowish discoloration of the corner of the nail and nail plate which eventually spreads and causes splitting of the nails or even the nail plate will separate from the nail bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>Diagnosis is usually made by clinical examination. Fungal materials can be demonstrated on microscopic examination of skin scales treated with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sometime the fungal culture can be done from the macerated skin but often is not required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment </code><ul><li>If the superficial skin is affected, apply the antifungal cream or lotion which you can buy in a drugstore (pharmacy}, try to keep the area clean and dry and you can also apply the dusting powder to promote dryness of the skin.</li><li>If the scalp is affected; use shampoo containing selenium sulfide (1%-2.5%}, zinc pyrithione (1%-2%}, or ketoconazole.</li><li>Sometime systemic antifungal medications needed to treat the infection. The common antifungal medications are fluconazole, Miconazole, Itraconazole, Terbinafine and Griseofulvin.</li><li>Bacterial superinfections usually require systemic antibiotics</li><li>Seriously infected or deep abscesses may require surgical drainage.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek a Doctor?</code><ul><li>If the ringworm lesions do not subside after a week applying over-the-counter antifungal cream, lotion or powder, you need to go to a doctor. As the ringworm might look similar to other skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis, it is important to have a physician diagnose this condition to treat it properly.</li><li>If you develop fever, increased pain, swelling, drainage, or redness, which could suggest a secondary bacterial infection of the ringworm lesion, go to a hospital immediately.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><ul><li>Ringworm is highly contagious; try to avoid contact with personal items of infected persons like clothing, towels, bedding, hair care items and wash the linens and clothes of an infected family members separately.</li><li>Avoid infected animals</li><li>Wear loose fitting cotton undergarments, keep the groin area dry and clean</li><li>Try to avoid tight fitted shoes; dry the toes after taking a shower, change shocks frequently</li></ul> </ul> </div>"

Primary lung cancers arise from cells in the lungs whereas secondary lung cancers are the ones which have spread to the lungs from another site or organ.</p><p>Lung cancers are broadly classified into small-cell cancer and non-small-cell cancer. Non-small-cell cancers are more common and includes&nbsp;three subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.&nbsp;Cancer spread outside lungs can occur to liver, bone, adrenal gland and brain.

Whenever the balance between these two opposing actions is disturbed, an ulcer can develop. &nbsp;Although it is a common belief among people, spicy food does not cause peptic ulcer disease. But it can worsen the pain if you already have an ulcer. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes and risk factors</code><p>There are several causes for the peptic ulcer diseases, ranging from bacterial infection to genetic predisposition. Some are discussed below:</p><ul><li><b>Helicobacter pylori infection:</b><ul><li><span>Majority of cases of gastric and duodenal ulcer are attributed to infection by &nbsp;H. pylori. It resides &nbsp;in the inner lining of the stomach wall, where it causes inflammation by the release of toxic compounds. </span></li><li><span>Helicobacter pylori is present in 30-60% of patients with gastric ulcers and nearly 70% of patients with duodenal ulcers. In developing countries, about 80% of the population may be infected with this bacteria by the age of 20 years. </span></li></ul></li><li><b>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</b><span> Regular use of painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac etc. on high dose can cause ulcers. Factors such as advanced age, simultaneous use of steroids will make you more prone towards developing an ulcer.</span></li><li><b><b>Too much acid production: </b><span>Diseases that increase acid production in the stomach can cause peptic ulcer disease. One of such disease is called zollinger-ellison syndrome.</span></b></li><li><b>Smoking:</b><span> Smoking increases your risk of ulcer. It delays healing of the ulcer and medicines to treat the disease&nbsp;become less effective if you smoke. It also increases the risk of ulcer perforation.</span></li><li><b>Other risk factors </b><span>: Heavy alcohol drinking, family history of PUD, old age, and concomitant use of oral steroids are also associated with higher risk of having a PUD.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms/Complications</code><ul><li><span>Pain: a burning pain felt in the upper abdomen is the most common symptom of PUD. Pain is felt more during empty stomach, worse at nights and may be relieved by eating food. </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Bleeding : the ulcer can erode into a blood vessel and cause bleeding which could be life threatening. It could present as dark stool or vomiting of blood. </span></li><li><span>Perforation: ulcer could erode all the way through the wall and cause perforation. It presents with a sudden severe and sharp pain in the abdomen, different from regular pain of PUD.&nbsp;This needs an emergent surgery.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Obstruction: Scarring leading to intestinal obstruction resulting in nausea/vomiting and weight loss. </span></li></ul><p><span>If you think you have peptic ulcer disease and you are losing weight, it is a danger sign of possible stomach cancer. You should see your doctor as soon as possible. Similarly dark stool is a danger sign of intestinal bleeding and you should contact your doctor immediately. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>PUD is diagnosed through the use of various tests and imaging/visualization methods. These include:</p><ul><li><span>Tests to diagnose H. pylori infection: your doctor will order a blood test or a stool test or a breath test to diagnose the infection. It depends on local availability of the test. If the test is positive you will need treatment with antibiotics.</span></li><li><span>Tests to visualize the ulcer: </span><ul><li><span>Endoscopy is done to visualize the ulcer. It is particularly helpful in identifying lesions too small to detect by X ray examination. Your doctor also can take a biopsy to rule out cancer during endoscopy..</span></li><li><span>Large ulcer can sometimes be diagnosed by barium swallow. In barium swallow, mixture of barium and water is swallowed followed by the X ray. Ulcer areas coated by barium can be seen on the X ray. Both gastric and duodenal ulcers appear as craters with well defined margins on the X ray examination. </span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>PUD is treated with lifestyle modification, medicine, endoscopy or&nbsp;surgery. </span></p><ul><li><span><em>Lifestyle modification:</em> Everyone who has PUD should stop smoking cigarettes, limit alcohol intake and avoid excessive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Healthy diet with fruits and vegetables may help in healing of the ulcer. </span></li><li><span><em>Medicines:</em> You will need two groups&nbsp;of medicine. One group is a set of&nbsp;three antibiotics that you will take for 2-3 weeks to treat the H. pylori infection. The second group is of acid lowering medicines&nbsp;like ranitidine and pantoprazole. Antacids are taken to relieve the pain and burning sensation.</span></li><li><span><em>Endoscopy or&nbsp;Surgery:</em> If you have bleeding complications from ulcer, it can be stopped by endoscopic procedures and local instillation of medication at the bleeding ulcer. Occasionally bleeding might be so severe that you might need surgery. </span></li></ul></ul></div>"

It is caused by the bacteria <em>Treponema pallidum </em>and is common in both male and female. It usually starts by causing painless sores, called chancres or rashes on the genitals, mouth, anus, or rectum. According to the symptoms seen and the duration of the disease syphilis has been divided into three stages. It can cause serious damage to various organs if not treated properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p>Syphilis is transmitted from syphilis infected persons to healthy ones through genital, oral or anal sex or from infected mother to fetus during pregnancy or to new-born baby while giving birth. Syphilis is caused by spiral shaped bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum </em>where the spiral shape allows it to burrow into mucous membranes or enter through minute breaks in the skin. Syphilis doesn’t pass through toilet seats, shared utensils or casual contact. Less commonly, syphilis can be passed through kisssing if broken skin comes into contact. The factors that can increase a person’s risk of infection can be listed as below :</p><ul><li>Unprotected sex</li><li>Multiple sex partners</li><li>HIV infection</li><li>Man who makes sexual relationship with men.</li></ul><code> Symptoms</code><p>The&nbsp;symptoms of syphilis&nbsp;are different in different stages of infection which are divided into three categories as below :</p><ul><li>Primary&nbsp;stage : After <em>Treponema pallidum </em>&nbsp;infection, the primary symptom will manifest with a chancre, usually within 21 days. They look like small circular sores which are painless, called chancre. Such chancres maybe seen inside lips too.&nbsp;Being these chancres usually painless and internal, they can be easily missed by both patients and doctors. Without treatment, a chancre will heal in anywhere from three to six weeks. The chancre contains the infectious bacteria, this stage is highly contagious. Any contact with the chancre can spread the infection.</li><li>Secondary stage : If primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary stage of syphilis may develop. It occurs within 4 to 10 weeks of a primary infection. This stage is characterized by a skin rash on almost any part of the body, including sores inside the mouth, vagina or anus. The copper colored rashes of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Fever, enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, weight loss, hair loss, headaches, joint aches and muscle aches have been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis. If this secondary stage of the infection is not treated, the infection can progress to tertiary stage of syphilis which is very complicated and severe. But sometimes, syphilis will show no symptoms at all, which is called latent syphilis.</li><li>Tertiary stage : The last stage of infection is known as tertiary syphilis. It&nbsp;is the most serious stage of infection. It’s characterized by major diseases of the skin, bones, heart, liver, and other organs.&nbsp;Neurosyphilis, arguably the most severe complication, affects the brain and is, by far, the most difficult to treat. This stage can be life-threatening. Few symptoms of tertiary syphilis are:<ul><li>blindness</li><li>deafness</li><li>mental illness</li><li>memory loss</li><li>destruction of soft tissue and bone</li><li>neurological disorders</li><li>meningitis</li><li>heart disease</li><li>neurosyphilis</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis of syphilis</code><p>There are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis : treponemal tests and non-treponemal tests. Treponemal tests identify antibodies to the causative organism and non-treponemal tests identify the body’s response to the infection but not to the organism itself.&nbsp;The blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called VDRL and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests must be followed by a treponemal test.</p><code>Treatment of syphilis</code><p>Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics. Penicillin IM is considered the drug of choice, but other antibiotics like doxycycline, tetracycline, azithromycin,&nbsp; should be used for a person who is allergic to penicillin.</p><p>Actually, penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis in all stages. Treatment with penicillin is safe during pregnancy too. Treatment kills the bacteria and prevents further organ damage, but will not reverse damage to the organs that has already occurred.</p><code>Preventive measures of syphilis</code><p>There is no vaccine available to prevent syphilis. Safe-sex practices, including condom use, can only prevent syphilis. But if the infectious chancre is located in a body are unprotected by a condom then only condom will not work.&nbsp; Washing or cleansing after sexual activity cannot prevent the infection. Neonatal syphilis is preventable by treating the mother early in her pregnancy.</p></ul></div>"

These germs reach the air sacs (lowest part of airways) after inhalation, overcoming body’s normal defense mechanism like nasal hairs, mucus and cough which are weakened by smoking or dust inhalation. Once in the lungs, these microorganisms cause inflammation and filling of the air sacs with pus which makes it difficult for oxygen to reach the blood. A healthy person often recovers quickly with regular care. But it can be serious in people with a weak immune system. Infants, young children and elders are specially vulnerable to the infection.</span></p><p><span>Pneumonia is transmitted from person to person by airborne droplets. The sick person expels bacteria during sneezing, coughing or talking. People living in close proximity or in crowded settings like schools or hostels can inhale the organism. It may take from few days up to few weeks for the person to develop pneumonia after inhalation of the organism depending on the type of organism, amount inhaled and immune status of the person.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms:</code><p><span>The symptoms of pneumonia can be mild or could be life threatening depending on type and amount of microorganism and age and general health of the person. &nbsp;Signs and symptoms of pneumonia include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fever, which may occur with chills and rigor.</span></li><li><span>Cough that &nbsp;may produce yellow or bloody sputum.</span></li><li><span>Difficulty breathing with rapid fast breathing.</span></li><li><span>Chest pain which is sharp on deep inspiration. </span></li><li><span>Some may also have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</span></li><li><span>Altered mental status in elderly.</span></li><li><span>People at extremes of age and weak immune system may not develop fever and instead may become hypothermic.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As severity of pneumonia increases, the patient may become lethargic. The patient may turn blue and show signs of labored breathing, which are danger signs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p><span>Most forms of pneumonia are caused by the bacteria and viruses present in the air we breath.</span></p><p><em><span>Bacteria:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Streptococcus pneumoniae – the most common cause of pneumonia.</span></li><li><span>Mycoplasma pneumoniae – causes “walking pneumonia”.</span></li><li><span>Staphylococcus aureus.</span></li><li><span>Klebsiella pneumoniae.</span></li><li><span>Tuberculosis.</span></li><li><span>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Viruses:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Influenza.</span></li><li><span>Respiratory syncytial virus-more common in children less than 5 years.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span>Fungi:</span></em></p><ul><li><span>Fungi found in soil and bird droppings ( Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis).&nbsp;</span>This is relatively uncommon, seen mainly in people with chronic illness and weak immune system.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Pneumonia can be classified into three types based on where you got the infection. If a person was at home or in the community, it is called community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patient may develop pneumonia&nbsp;during hospital stays&nbsp;for other chronic illness.&nbsp;This form of infection is&nbsp;called hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). A person on a ventilator for a long duration may also develop pneumonia, which called ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The common organisms that cause pneumonia in these different setting are slightly different and so are the treatment options and the prognosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk factors</code><p><span>People with the following conditions are at risk of pneumonia:</span></p><ul><li><span>Smokers: the defense mechanisms of lungs (cough, mucus clearance, etc.) are decreased due to smoking.</span></li><li><span>Older age people.</span></li><li><span>Structural lung diseases like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD}, bronchiectasis &nbsp;increase the chances of pneumonia. </span></li><li><span>Alcoholics: aspiration of material into airways causes infection of lungs. </span></li><li><span>Viral infections like influenza.</span></li><li><span>Weak immune system: HIV, malnutrition (especially in children}, medicines that suppress immune system ( like steroids, anti cancer drugs).</span></li><li><span>Exposure to bird droppings (Chlamydia pneumoniae}, poultry (bird flu) or farm animals (Q fever) increases the risk of certain types of pneumonia.</span></li><li><span>Infants and young children are likely develop respiratory insufficiency because of pneumonia.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>When to seek medical care</code><p><span>Early treatment of pneumonia can save lives, especially of infants and small children. So it is wise to seek care when fever and fast breathing is seen. The following signs warrant an urgent need to seek medical care:</span></p><ul><li><span>Bluish discoloration of lips or fingers suggests critically low oxygen exchange by the lungs.</span></li><li><span>Poor feeding in infants; inability to suck.</span></li><li><span>Distressed breathing: noisy breathing with movement of neck muscles on respiration.</span></li><li><span>Inability to speak full sentences due to breathlessness.</span></li><li><span>Chest indrawing, especially in children.</span></li><li><span>Lethargy or unconsciousness is present in advanced disease and may obscure other danger signs like difficulty breathing.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment options</code><p><span>In addition to history and physical exam, chest x-ray, blood and sputum tests are done to make the diagnosis for pneumonia. Additional tests may be needed based on clinical situation.&nbsp;</span><span>Pneumonia is treated by antibiotics and proper supportive measures. Severe pneumonia needs hospitalization. Mild cases can be treated at home.</span></p><p><span>Antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, azithromycin, or cephalosporin are commonly used to treat bacterial pneumonia. Paracetamol or Acetaminophen can be given for fever. Nebulized saline helps to clear secretions and make breathing easier. </span></p><p><span>If not properly treated on time, pneumonia can be complicated by accumulation of &nbsp;fluid/pus around the lungs. It can also spread the bacteria through blood to bone (osteomyelitis}, brain (meningitis}, or other tissues of the body. But respiratory failure is the most serious complication of pneumonia. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prevention</strong></p><p><span>Vaccination against Influenza and pneumonia help prevent this disease&nbsp;or its complication.&nbsp;</span><span>Pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced to immunization schedule for infants in many developing countries fairly&nbsp;recently.&nbsp;</span><span>Stopping smoking and alcohol use improves airway defense mechanisms and helps prevent pneumonia.</span></p></ul> </div>"

It’s serious illness that can cause permanent damage to the heart. Rheumatic fever is common in underdeveloped countries like Nepal. It is most common in children (5 to 15 years old) but can occur in younger children and adults as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Causes</code><p>Rheumatic fever usually follows a throat infection caused by a specific group of bacteria called Group A Streptococcus. The exact association between strep infection and rheumatic fever is not clear but it’s thought to be immune mediated. The streptococcal bacteria contains a protein similar to the one found in the certain tissues of the body mainly heart, joints, skin and central nervous system. Strep throat, if not treated on time or inadequately treated, the immune system cells that would normally target the bacteria; may also target the these tissues resulting in inflammation of those tissues. Rheumatic fever symptoms are mainly from the inflammation of those affected tissues.</p><p>Rheumatic fever does not affect all individuals who have had a strep throat infection.</p><p>The risk factors for rheumatic fever include:</p><ul><li>Young age (5-15 years of age)</li><li>Overcrowding and poor sanitation</li><li>Lack of access to medical services</li><li>Family history</li><li>Poverty and malnutrition</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Symptoms</code><p>The symptoms of the disease may vary from person to person. Some may experience a wide range of symptoms whereas some may only get a few. The symptoms usually occur about 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of strep throat infection.</p><p>The symptoms are seen from inflammation in the heart, joints, central nervous system and skin:</p><ul><li>Fever (generally high grade)</li><li>Chest pain (mostly while breathing)</li><li>Palpitation (feeling of your own heart beat)</li><li>Lethargy or fatigue</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Swelling of limbs</li><li>Pain and swelling in joints in the wrists, elbows, knees and ankles</li><li>Pain in one joint that moves to another joint</li><li>Small painless nodules under the skin (subcutaneous nodules)</li><li>Involuntary and uncontrollable jerky (dancing) movements of hands, feet and face (Sydenham chorea)</li><li>Painless, flat rashes with ragged edges known as erythema marginatum</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>You should see your doctor if your child has signs and symptoms of a throat infection. You should immediately see a doctor if your child shows signs or symptoms of rheumatic fever. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection using the Jones criteria.</p><p>Your doctor will advise you to undergo some tests like to look for causes, make the diagnosis and detect complications:</p><ul><li>Throat swabs to grow streptococci causing sore throat/pharyngitis</li><li>Blood testing for looking for evidence of recent streptococcal infection. (ASO and anti DNAse level)</li><li>ECG to observe the electrical activity of heart</li><li>Chest X ray to see enlargement of heart and evidence of heart failure</li><li>Echocardiogram to evaluate the damage to the heart valves</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment</code><p><span>The main goals of the treatment are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Symptomatic treatment</span></li><li><span>Eradication of streptococcal infection (strep throat) and </span></li><li><span>Prophylaxis against future recurrence and to prevent progression of cardiac disease</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Anti – inflammatory agents (Aspirin, NSAIDS, low dose glucocorticoids) are the mainstay of symptomatic treatment of Acute rheumatic fever. It reduces fever, alleviates symptoms of inflammation in joints and heart. Patients with severe damage to the heart may need treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and digoxin. &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Bed rest is enforced even if the patient feels well enough. Regular activity should not be </span><span>resumed till inflammation has subsided. </span></p><p><span>Diazepam or anticonvulsant medications (valproic acid, carbamazepine) is given for </span><span>chorea (abnormal jerky movements of hand, feet or face)</span></p><ul><li><span>Antibiotics (oral – Penicillin V or &nbsp;Amoxicillin or IM Benzathine Penicillin) are used to treat strep throat. Adequate and appropriate antibiotics treatment reduces the risk of&nbsp;</span>getting rheumatic fever</li></ul><ul><li><span>Penicillin (Benzathine Penicillin G) is the preferred choice for long term prophylaxis to prevent recurrence and to prevent progression of the cardiac disease</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><p>Primary Prevention:</p><p>Primary prevention means prevention of development of rheumatic fever after a throat infection. Proper diagnosis and adequate antibiotics treatment of strep throat can prevent acute rheumatic fever in most cases.</p><p>Secondary Prevention:</p><p>Secondary prevention means prevention of recurrent rheumatic fever after successful treatment of first episode of rheumatic fever. A child who has had attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrence after subsequent strep throat infection and needs continuous antibiotics prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences. In general continuous antibiotics are needed upto age of 25 years. If there is permanent significant damage to the heart valves , antibiotics are needed for longer duration and possibly for life long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul> </div>"

Hence, having HIV infection doesn’t mean you have AIDS. The progression from HIV to AIDS takes many years.</p><p>AIDS is a chronic debilitating condition for which there is no cure. People with HIV die form one of AIDS related illness. However, once a disease that caused a rapid death, HIV infection now, can be managed with medications just like other chronic illness. Death from HIV/AIDS has markedly decreased in developed countries but it continues to kill many people in resource poor countries in Africa and Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Stages and symptoms of of HIV infection</code><ul><li><strong>Stage 1: Acute HIV infection. </strong>Two to four weeks after HIV exposure, patient has flu like illness fever, headache, sore throat and enlarged lymph glands in the neck.</li><li><strong>Stage 2: Chronic HIV infection</strong>: Patient usually do not have any symptoms during this stage which can last for many years to decades with medications. However, patient can spread the virus. There is slow but continuous weakening of the immune system and the virus continues to multiply in the body. Towards the latter stages, they start to develop symptoms like diarrhea, fatigue, herpes zoster and oral thrush.</li><li><strong>Stage 3: AIDS:</strong> This is advanced stage of HIV infection. Immune system is severely damaged. Patients develop opportunistic infection or cancer, some very unusual infections (not seen in people with normal immune system). Fever, unexplained weight loss, weakness are common symptoms.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Risk Factors</code><p>HIV spreads when the body fluids of infected person enters the bloodstream of the exposed person. Coming in contact with body fluids like blood, semen, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids and breast milk of an infected person can HIV spread HIV. Conditions that increase risk of HIV infection are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Unprotected sex: </strong>means engaging in sexual act without using a condom. Anal sex has a higher risk than vaginal sex. The risk increases if you have multiple sexual partners.</li><li><strong>Use of intravenous drugs:</strong> Transmitted through sharing needles and syringes with someone who is infected with HIV.</li><li><strong>Mother to child transmission:</strong> HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20%. The risk is around 35% for breastfeeding.</li><li><strong>Sexually transmitted diseases: </strong>People who already have a , are more likely to acquire HIV infection during sex with an infected partner.</li><li><strong>Occupational: </strong>Rarel<strong>y </strong>HIV can be contracted in healthcare settings through accidental needle sticks or contact with contaminated fluids.</li><li><strong>Kissing:</strong> You can acquire HIV infection from deep, open-mouth kissing of an infected partner if he or she has has oral sores or bleeding gums and that blood gets into your bloodstream from skin breaks during deep kissing.</li><li>Other methods of HIV infection: People may get HIV infection from blood or blood product transfusion and organ transplantation from infected donor. Blood and blood products are routinely screened for HIV.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HIV <strong>does not</strong> spread by:</p><ul><li>Air or water</li><li>Mosquitoes, ticks or other insect bite</li><li>Saliva, tears, or sweat that is not mixed with the blood of an HIV-positive person</li><li>Shaking hands, hugging, sharing toilets, sharing dishes/drinking glasses, with someone who is HIV-positive</li><li>Other sexual activities that don’t involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Diagnosis</code><p>HIV infection is suspected based on the symptoms, exposure history and presence of risk factors. The diagnosis is confirmed by checking antibodies in your blood against the virus. However, it takes upto 12 weeks to develop an antibody after acquiring the infection. Hence , these days diagnosis is made by directly detecting a viral protein in the blood which can be detected very early after acquiring infection. After the diagnosis, you will need other tests to tailor treatments. Your doctor will check the number of immune cells in your blood, number of virus particles in the blood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Treatment Options</code><p>There is no cure for HIV infection. However, once a nearly fatal disease with rapid progression, people with HIV live a fairly long life these days with medications. Treatment consists of</p><ul><li>Antiretroviral therapy (ART): ART is recommended for all HIV infected persons. Combination of medicines is used. They work by different mechanism, either by preventing viral entry into the immune cell or preventing viral multiplication. It is very important to follow up closely with your healthcare provider to monitor for response to treatment, medication side effect and emergence of drug resistance.</li><li>Treatment of opportunistic infections and cancers</li><li>Supportive treatment:<ul><li>Stop smoking, alcohol or illegal drugs</li><li>Good nutrition</li><li>Regular physical exercise</li><li>Vaccination against some infectious diseases</li><li>Social and family support</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Who to get tested for HIV?</code><ul><li>As a routine care, all adults should be tested for HIV. Person at high risk should be tested more frequently</li><li>If you have multiple sexual partners</li><li>Had unprotected sex</li><li>Had sex with person known to have HIV/AIDS</li><li>When pregnant</li><li>If a pregnant woman has HIV, seek medical care, this is important to reduce the risk to her unborn child</li><li>If you had needle stick injury contaminated with an HIV infected person</li><li>If you are a man who have sex with man</li><li>If you develops symptoms like fever, cough, extreme weight loss, weakness, abdominal pain, diarrhea</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Prevention</code><ul><li>Limit the number of sexual partners</li><li>Use condoms</li><li>Never share injection needles</li><li>Get tested for HIV if you have suspicion</li><li>Pre exposure prophylaxis: persons at very high risk of ongoing HIV infection can lower their risk by taking antiretroviral medicines</li><li>Preexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medicines should started as soon as possible after being exposed to HIV.

They dissolve in fat and then absorbed from intestine. </span></li><li><b>Water-soluble vitamins</b><span>: Vitamins C and B complex (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B12 and Folic acid). &nbsp;</span><span>They</span><span> dissolve in water and are absorbed directly into the blood from the intestine. </span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Vitamins are not synthesized by humans (except Vitamin D and Vitamin K}, so have to be ingested in diet or supplement.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin A Deficiency</code><p><span>Vitamin A is important for &nbsp;</span><span>vision, integrity of tissues and immune system.&nbsp;Its primary sources include</span><span>&nbsp;green leafy vegetables, carrot, sweet potato, fish, liver, whole milk, egg yolk, and butter.&nbsp;</span><span>Children and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers need more </span><span>Vitamin A. Children who are malnourished or have measles have greater risk of having Vitamin A deficiency. </span></p><p><span>Vitamin A deficiency can lead to:</span></p><ul><li><span>Night blindness;</span></li><li><span>Dryness of &nbsp;outer lining of eyeball (conjunctiva and cornea},</span></li><li><span>Corneal ulceration and blindness;</span></li><li><span>Poor bone growth;</span></li><li><span>Skin changes (damage to hair follicles, skin glands}, or</span></li><li><span>Increase risk of infections like measles.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In many countries, all children between 6 months and 5 years of age are routinely given Vitamin A two times in a year and every pregnant woman is given a dose of Vitamin A at the time of delivery. This routine supplementation of Vitamin A has contributed to significant decrease in blindness resulting from Vitamin A deficiency and under-five child mortality, particularly resulting from complications of measles. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin D Deficiency</code><p><span>Vitamin D is needed for maintaining strong bones. It helps your body absorb calcium from your intestine and to maintain calcium phosphorus balance required for bone mineralization. Vitamin D has 2 sources:</span></p><ul><li><span>Dietary Source: from milk, milk products, egg yolk, liver, fish.</span></li><li><span>Synthesized in the body (in skin, liver and kidney) with the help of sunlight.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Deficiency of Vitamin D can lead to defective mineralization of bone:</span></p><ul><li><span>In children this defect can cause rickets – soft weak bones which become deformed. </span></li><li><span>In adults it causes osteomalacia or soft bones.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Typical causes of Vitamin D deficiency are: diet poor in Vitamin D, &nbsp;failure of absorption, inadequate exposure to sunlight and diseases of liver or kidneys. Some medications (anticonvulsants) can also cause Vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;</span><span>Some symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency include poor growth, bow legs in children and bone pain and muscle weakness in adults.

However, it is important to avoid excess consumption of Vitamin D, as such excess consumption&nbsp;can be harmful.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin E Deficiency</code><p><span>Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. It is found in eggs, meat, oil and green leafy vegetables. Vitamin E deficiency can cause nerve and muscle damage that results in loss of sensation in the arms and legs or muscle weakness. </span></p><p><span>Deficiency of Vitamin E in preterm babies can cause damage to red blood cells. Vitamin E supplementation can be helpful in treatment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin K Deficiency</code><p><span>Vitamin K helps in blood clotting process. Clotting factors are made in the liver. Sources of Vitamin K are diet (green leafy vegetables such as spinach, broccoli) and bacteria in the intestine. Deficiency of Vitamin K leads to excess bleeding. </span></p><p><span>Causes of Vitamin&nbsp;K deficiency are use of medicine (blood thinner like Warfarin) that block action of Vitamin K or antibiotics that kill bacteria in the intestine. Vitamin K deficiency is common in newborns. Supplementation typically corrects the deficiency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin C Deficiency</code><p><span>Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) is an&nbsp;antioxidant that is needed for healthy skin and connective tissue. It promotes healing and helps the body absorb iron. Vitamin C comes from fruits, particularly citrus fruits (orange, grape) and vegetables like tomatoes, broccoli, and greens. </span></p><p><span>Deficiency of Vitamin C may cause Scurvy – anemia, gum bleeding, bruising and poor wound healing. It is treated with supplementation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><code>Vitamin B Deficiency:</code><p><span>There are eight types of Vitamins in Vitamin B Complex, namely B1 (Thiamine}, B2 (Riboflavin}, B3 (Niacin}, B5 (Pantothenic Acid}, B6 (Pyridoxine}, B7 (Biotin}, B12 and Folic Acid. These vitamins help convert food we eat into energy. Vitamin B12 and Folic acid also help form red blood cells. Sources of Vitamin B complex are&nbsp;fish, poultry, meat, eggs, dairy products, leafy green vegetables, beans, and peas. </span></p><p><span>Vitamin B deficiency causes different symptoms depending on the specific Vitamin B that is deficient.&nbsp;</span><span>Lack of Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid can cause anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs mainly in strict vegetarians, also causes tingling and numbness of limbs due to nerve damage.&nbsp;</span><span>Vitamin B6 deficiency can occur due to medicine for TB. Its symptoms are numbness and tingling. </span></p><p><span>Deficiency of Vitamin B1 can occur due to excess alcohol drinking. It causes a Beriberi, which leads to swelling of body due to heart failure or altered sensorium due to damage to the brain. </span></p><p><span>Deficiency of Vitamin B2 causes soreness and cracks in lips and mouth. </span><span>Deficiency of Vitamin B3 causes pellagra, which manifests with skin rashes, diarrhea and forgetfulness.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin B deficiency can be corrected by appropriate supplementation.</span></p></ul></div>"

The scar tissue is the final result of injuries to the liver by various substances. The destruction of normal liver tissue leads to reduced synthesis of proteins needed for the body, reduced clotting factors needed for blood coagulation. Similarly, toxins produced in the body that are normally removed by the liver accumulate in the body, which can lead to confusion and coma. The scar tissue  blocks the blood flow through the liver and causes pressure in the blood vessels to rise that lead to buildup of fluid (ascites) in the abdomen. These enlarged blood vessel (esophageal varices) can rupture causing severe bleeding which could be fatal. Patients with cirrhosis are more susceptible to side effects of medication, and  prone to infection and kidney failure. Cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer. It is a serious medical condition and a cause of premature death.",
