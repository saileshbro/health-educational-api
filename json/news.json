      "title": "Learning new vocabulary during deep sleep",
      "body": "<div><ul><p> Sleeping time is sometimes considered unproductive time. This raises the question whether the time spent asleep could be used more productively — e.g. for learning a new language? To date sleep research focused on the stabilization and strengthening (consolidation) of memories that had been formed during preceding wakefulness. However, learning during sleep has rarely been examined. There is considerable evidence for wake-learned information undergoing a recapitulation by replay in the sleeping brain. The replay during sleep strengthens the still fragile memory traces und embeds the newly acquired information in the preexisting store of knowledge.</p><div><p> If re-play during sleep improves the storage of wake-learned information, then first-play — i.e., the initial processing of new information — should also be feasible during sleep, potentially carving out a memory trace that lasts into wakefulness. This was the research question of Katharina Henke, Marc Züst und Simon Ruch of the Institute of Psychology and of the Interfaculty Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep” at the University of Bern, Switzerland. These investigators now showed for the first time that new foreign words and their translation words could be associated during a midday nap with associations stored into wakefulness. Following waking, participants could reactivate the sleep-formed associations to access word meanings when represented with the formerly sleep-played foreign words. The hippocampus, a brain structure essential for wake associative learning, also supported the retrieval of sleep-formed associations. The results of this experiment are published open access in the scientific journal&nbsp;<em>Current Biology</em>.</p> <code>The brain cells’ active states are central for sleep-learning</code><p> The research group of Katharina Henke examined whether a sleeping person is able to form new semantic associations between played foreign words and translation words during the brain cells’ active states, the so-called “Up-states.” When we reach deep sleep stages, our brain cells progressively coordinate their activity. During deep sleep, the brain cells are commonly active for a brief period of time before they jointly enter into a state of brief inactivity. The active state is called “Up-state” and the inactive state “Down-state.” The two states alternate about every half-second.</p><p> Semantic associations between sleep-played words of an artificial language and their German translations words were only encoded and stored, if the second word of a pair was repeatedly (2, 3 or 4 times) played during an Up-state. E.g., when a sleeping person heard the word pairs “tofer = key” and “guga = elephant,” then after waking they were able to categorize with a better-than-chance accuracy whether the sleep-played foreign words denominated something large (“Guga”) or small (“Tofer”). “It was interesting that language areas of the brain and the hippocampus — the brain’s essential memory hub — were activated during the wake retrieval of sleep-learned vocabulary because these brain structures normally mediate wake learning of new vocabulary,” says Marc Züst, co-first-author of this paper. “These brain structures appear to mediate memory formation independently of the prevailing state of consciousness — unconscious during deep sleep, conscious during wakefulness.”</p> <code>Memory formation does not require consciousness</code><p> Besides its practical relevance, this new evidence for sleep-learning challenges current theories of sleep and theories of memory. The notion of sleep as an encapsulated mental state, in which we are detached from the physical environment is no longer tenable. “We could disprove that sophisticated learning be impossible during deep sleep,” says Simon Ruch, co-first-author. The current results underscore a new theoretical notion of the relationship between memory and consciousness that Katharina Henke published in 2010 (N<em>ature Reviews Neuroscience</em>). “In how far and with what consequences deep sleep can be utilized for the acquisition of new information will be a topic of research in upcoming years,” says Katharina Henke.</p> <code>Decoding sleep</code><p> The research group of Katharina Henke is part of the Interfaculty Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep: From Neurons to Health &amp; Mind” (IRC). Decoding Sleep is a large, interdisciplinary research project that is financed by the University of Bern, Switzerland. Thirteen research groups in medicine, biology, psychology, and informatics are part of the IRC. The aim of these research groups is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in sleep, consciousness, and cognition.</p><p> The reported study was carried out in collaboration with Roland Wiest who is affiliated with the Support Center for Advanced Neuroimaging (SCAN) at the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, University of Bern. Both research groups also belong to the BENESCO consortium, which consists of 22 interdisciplinary research groups specialized in sleep medicine, epilepsy and research on altered states of consciousness.</p></div></ul></div>",

But these tests are invasive, expensive and may only show results when the disease has already started to progress.</p><p>Despite decades of scientific research, there is no treatment that can slow the progression of Alzheimer‘s. Current drugs can do no more than ease some of the symptoms.</p><p>Having a simple, low-cost blood test could make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to find enough people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s to test potential new drugs to fight the disease, said Katsuhiko Yanagisawa, who co-led the Nature study at the Japanese National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology.</p><p>Since Alzheimer’s disease is thought to start developing years before patients have any symptoms of memory loss, experts say an important factor in finding an effective treatment will be the ability to accurately detect signs of the disease early.</p><p>“You have got to walk before you run. You have to learn to diagnose the disease directly before you can hope to see the effect of therapeutic intervention.

But now-a-days, youth are also being diagnosed with the disorder, showed a documentary screened at Moksha in Jhamsikhel.</p><p>In the documentary – Living with Parkinson’s Disease – various personalities including veteran actor Madan Krishna Shrestha, and initiator of the project and Parkinson’s disease advocate Banita Khanal, among others, shared their stories, struggles, and experiences living with the degenerative brain disorder.</p><p>“When I was young, I used to say I would scale Mt Everest one day. But I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at the age of 26, seven years after suffering from it,” shared Khanal.</p><p>The disease shows different symptoms in different persons including difficulty in movement and speaking, trembling, rigidity, postural difficulties, lack of confidence, nervousness, memory loss, loss of taste and smell, among others.</p><p>Similarly, actor Shrestha, who has been diagnosed with the disease, shared, “I tried everything from physiotherapy, acupressure to radiotherapy but the symptoms that I had developed did not subside. Later, Dr Sarvottam Shrestha said I was suffering from Parkinson’s.”</p><p>“I could not drive, hold a spoon, or even put on shoes. Later a doctor from Japan Dr Takaomi Taira first tried exercises, and when that did not work he&nbsp; suggested I needed a Deep Brain Stimulation&nbsp;(DBS) surgery and installed a pacemaker,” shared Shrestha.</p><p>Shrestha also expressed the irony of the situation where being an actor, due to his condition, he finds it challenging to emote and express, as Parkinson’s also affects a person’s ability to show facial expressions. Nevertheless, his positive attitude and humour were intact while sharing his story with the audience.</p><p>Likewise, Tilak Sapkota, a Hotel Management teacher who was diagnosed with the degenerative disorder six years ago, shared that the problem started with his hands. “My face gradually started to lose its expressions and people actually started noticing it. My wife took me to a few neurologists. After visiting 3-4 doctors, we came to know that it was Parkinson’s. My wife was my biggest support then.”</p><p>Medication, physical exercise, psychological strength, will power, and support from family and friends are the best ways to keep moving, shared the patients.</p><p>The documentary also showed how patients visited shamans to understand and find solution to the symptoms they were suffering from because they had not been diagnosed yet, mainly because Parkinson’s disease was not out in the light, not thought to be a condition that could be affecting the population.</p><p>But the patients shared how it is real and how they came in terms with their diagnosis. And though the disorder is not reversible, the condition can definitely be treated and controlled with medication. Dopamine and related medicines can help minimise the effects of the disease.</p><p>The documentary was followed by a panel discussion with panelists Khanal, Shrestha, Bhavana Rana, Neurologist Dr Baburam Pokharel, Geriatric Physician Dr Ramesh Kandel and Clinical Psychologist Pramesh Man Pradhan.</p><p>Medical experts and scientists have been conducting a stem cell research in Australia to find a solution to Parkinson’s.</p><p>“The cause of the disorder cannot easily be ascertained. There could be various reasons. Change in the genetics can be one of the causes of the degenerative disease. Apart from that, people who work with pesticides have high chances of suffering from Parkinson’s. Exposure to or consumption of neurotoxin MPTP directly or indirectly could also cause the symptoms to begin. Likewise unadministered use of medications can also be harmful and could at some point of time induce Parkinson’s,” shared Dr Pokharel explaining the possibilities.</p><p>“I say Parkinson’s is way better than other neuro-degenerative diseases because at least it can be diagnosed and controlled. Most of the neurological diseases have not been identified yet, forget the treatment,” stated Dr Pokharel.</p><p>The panel members also raised the issue of there not being any government facility that would deal with the neurological disorders, where people could go for diagnosis and treatment. This has created further difficulties to the people who suffer from Parkinson’s and other neurological disorders because the private institutions are not only expensive but not really focused on the specific cause. Having a government facility focused on this sector would be extremely helpful.</p><p>The panel discussion also shared challenges faced by the family members or caretakers of persons suffering from Parkinson’s. Leading this discussion was Bhavana Rana whose mother has Parkinson’s. She shared with the audience her experience in this regard and how to best take care of a person who is suffering from the disorder, highlighting the importance of being positive and loving towards the patients.</p></div></ul>",

Lower-than-normal zinc levels may contribute to high blood pressure (hypertension) by altering the way the kidneys handle sodium.</p><div><p> Zinc deficiency is common in people with chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. People with low zinc levels are also at a higher risk for hypertension. The way in which the kidneys either excrete sodium into the urine or reabsorb it into the body — specifically through a pathway called the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) — also plays a role in blood pressure control. Less sodium in the urine typically corresponds with higher blood pressure. Recent research has suggested that zinc may help regulate proteins that in turn regulate the NCC, but a direct link between zinc-deficiency-induced hypertension has not been examined.</p><p> Researchers compared male mice with zinc deficiency to healthy controls with normal zinc levels. The zinc-deficient mice developed high blood pressure and a corresponding decrease in urinary sodium excretion. The control group did not experience the same changes. A small group of the zinc-deficient mice were fed a zinc-rich diet partway through the study. Once the animals’ zinc reached adequate levels, blood pressure began to drop and urinary sodium levels increased. “These significant findings demonstrate that enhanced renal [sodium] reabsorption plays a critical role in [zinc-deficiency]-induced hypertension,” the research team wrote.</p><p> “Understanding the specific mechanisms by which [zinc deficiency] contributes to [blood pressure] dysregulation may have an important effect on the treatment of hypertension in chronic disease settings,” the researchers added.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>",

      "body": "<div><ul><p>A daily dose of baking soda may help reduce the destructive inflammation of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, scientists say.</p><p>They have some of the first evidence of how the cheap, over-the-counter antacid can encourage our spleen to promote instead an anti-inflammatory environment that could be therapeutic in the face of inflammatory disease, Medical College of Georgia scientists report in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Immunology</em>.</p><p>They have shown that when rats or healthy people drink a solution of baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, it becomes a trigger for the stomach to make more acid to digest the next meal and for little-studied mesothelial cells sitting on the spleen to tell the fist-sized organ that there’s no need to mount a protective immune response.</p><p>“It’s most likely a hamburger not a bacterial infection,” is basically the message, says Dr. Paul O’Connor, renal physiologist in the MCG Department of Physiology at Augusta University and the study’s corresponding author.</p><p>Mesothelial cells line body cavities, like the one that contains our digestive tract, and they also cover the exterior of our organs to quite literally keep them from rubbing together. About a decade ago, it was found that these cells also provide another level of protection. They have little fingers, called microvilli, that sense the environment, and warn the organs they cover that there is an invader and an immune response is needed.</p><p>Drinking baking soda, the MCG scientists think, tells the spleen — which is part of the immune system, acts like a big blood filter and is where some white blood cells, like macrophages, are stored — to go easy on the immune response. “Certainly drinking bicarbonate affects the spleen and we think it’s through the mesothelial cells,” O’Connor says.</p><p>The conversation, which occurs with the help of the chemical messenger acetylcholine, appears to promote a landscape that shifts against inflammation, they report.</p><p>In the spleen, as well as the blood and kidneys, they found after drinking water with baking soda for two weeks, the population of immune cells called macrophages, shifted from primarily those that promote inflammation, called M1, to those that reduce it, called M2. Macrophages, perhaps best known for their ability to consume garbage in the body like debris from injured or dead cells, are early arrivers to a call for an immune response.</p><p>In the case of the lab animals, the problems were hypertension and chronic kidney disease, problems which got O’Connor’s lab thinking about baking soda.</p><p>One of the many functions of the kidneys is balancing important compounds like acid, potassium and sodium. With kidney disease, there is impaired kidney function and one of the resulting problems can be that the blood becomes too acidic, O’Connor says. Significant consequences can include increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.</p><p>“It sets the whole system up to fail basically,” O’Connor says. Clinical trials have shown that a daily dose of baking soda can not only reduce acidity but actually slow progression of the kidney disease, and it’s now a therapy offered to patients.</p><p>“We started thinking, how does baking soda slow progression of kidney disease?” O’Connor says.</p><p>That’s when the anti-inflammatory impact began to unfold as they saw reduced numbers of M1s and increased M2s in their kidney disease model after consuming the common compound.</p><p>When they looked at a rat model without actual kidney damage, they saw the same response. So the basic scientists worked with the investigators at MCG’s Georgia Prevention Institute to bring in healthy medical students who drank baking soda in a bottle of water and also had a similar response.</p><p>“The shift from inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile is happening everywhere,” O’Connor says. “We saw it in the kidneys, we saw it in the spleen, now we see it in the peripheral blood.”</p><p>The shifting landscape, he says, is likely due to increased conversion of some of the proinflammatory cells to anti-inflammatory ones coupled with actual production of more anti-inflammatory macrophages. The scientists also saw a shift in other immune cell types, like more regulatory T cells, which generally drive down the immune response and help keep the immune system from attacking our own tissues. That anti-inflammatory shift was sustained for at least four hours in humans and three days in rats.</p><p>The shift ties back to the mesothelial cells and their conversations with our spleen with the help of acetylcholine. Part of the new information about mesothelial cells is that they are neuron-like, but not neurons O’Connor is quick to clarify.</p><p>“We think the cholinergic (acetylcholine) signals that we know mediate this anti-inflammatory response aren’t coming directly from the vagal nerve innervating the spleen, but from the mesothelial cells that form these connections to the spleen,” O’Connor says.</p><p>In fact, when they cut the vagal nerve, a big cranial nerve that starts in the brain and reaches into the heart, lungs and gut to help control things like a constant heart rate and food digestion, it did not impact the mesothelial cells’ neuron-like behavior.</p><p>The affect, it appears, was more local because just touching the spleen did have an effect.</p><p>When they removed or even just moved the spleen, it broke the fragile mesothelial connections and the anti-inflammatory response was lost, O’Connor says. In fact, when they only slightly moved the spleen as might occur in surgery, the previously smooth covering of mesothelial cells became lumpier and changed colors.</p><p>“We think this helps explain the cholinergic (acetylcholine) anti-inflammatory response that people have been studying for a long time,” O’Connor says.</p><p>Studies are currently underway at other institutions that, much like vagal nerve stimulation for seizures, electrically stimulate the vagal nerve to tamp down the immune response in people with rheumatoid arthritis. While there is no known direct connection between the vagal nerve and the spleen — and O’Connor and his team looked again for one — the treatment also attenuates inflammation and disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis, researchers at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research reported in 2016 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>O’Connor hopes drinking baking soda can one day produce similar results for people with autoimmune disease.</p><p>“You are not really turning anything off or on, you are just pushing it toward one side by giving an anti-inflammatory stimulus,” he says, in this case, away from harmful inflammation. “It’s potentially a really safe way to treat inflammatory disease.”</p><p>The spleen also got bigger with consuming baking soda, the scientists think because of the anti-inflammatory stimulus it produces. Infection also can increase spleen size and physicians often palpate the spleen when concerned about a big infection.</p><p>Other cells besides neurons are known to use the chemical communicator acetylcholine. Baking soda also interact with acidic ingredients like buttermilk and cocoa in cakes and other baked goods to help the batter expand and, along with heat from the oven, to rise. It can also help raise the pH in pools, is found in antacids and can help clean your teeth and tub.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ul></div>",

Also, some people lost as much as 60 pounds and others gained 15 pounds — more evidence that genetic characteristics and diet type appeared to make no difference.</p><p>What seemed to make a difference was healthful eating. Participants on both diets who consumed the fewest processed foods, sugary drinks, unhealthy fats and ate the most vegetables lost the most weight.</p><p>The results suggest that “precision medicine is not as important as eating mindfully, getting rid of packaged, processed food” and avoiding unhealthy habits like eating while watching television, said lead author Christopher Gardner.</p><p>The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p><p>Participants had 22 health education classes during the study and were encouraged to be physically active, but the focus was on what they ate. They were advised to choose high-quality foods but were not given suggested calorie limits nor were they provided with specific foods. Results are based on what they reported eating.</p><p>During the first two months, dieters in each group were told to limit carbohydrates or fats to 20 grams daily, about the amount that’s in 1 1/2 slices of whole wheat bread and a handful of nuts respectively.

Both groups reduced their daily calorie intake by an average of about 500 calories.</p><p>The study was well-conducted but because participants were not provided with specific foods and self-reported their food choices, it wasn’t rigorous enough to disprove the idea that certain genes and insulin levels may affect which types of diets lead to weight loss, said Dr David Ludwig, a Boston Children’s Hospital obesity researcher.</p><p>Dr Frank Hu, nutrition chief at Harvard’s School of Public Health, has called precision nutrition a promising approach and said the study wasn’t a comprehensive test of all gene variations that might affect individual responses to weight loss diets.</p><p>“In any weight loss diets, adherence to the diet and the overall quality of the diet are probably more important than any other factors,” Hu said.</p></div></ul>",

Their study results, in 83 men, will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s 100th annual meeting in Chicago, Ill.</p><p>Like the pill for women, the experimental male oral contraceptive — called dimethandrolone undecanoate, or DMAU — combines activity of an androgen (male hormone) like testosterone, and a progestin, and is taken once a day, said the study’s senior investigator, Stephanie Page, M.D., PhD, professor of medicine at the University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.</p><p>“DMAU is a major step forward in the development of a once-daily ‘male pill’,” Page said. “Many men say they would prefer a daily pill as a reversible contraceptive, rather than long-acting injections or topical gels, which are also in development.”</p><p>Progress toward a male birth control pill has been stymied because, according to Page, available oral forms of testosterone may cause liver inflammation, and they clear the body too quickly for once-daily dosing, thus requiring two doses a day. However, DMAU contains undecanoate, a long-chain fatty acid, which Page said slows this clearance. DMAU is being developed by the National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded this study.</p><p>The study included 100 healthy men, ages 18 to 50 years, and took place at the University of Washington Medical Center and at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, CA (led by co-author Christina Wang, M.D.).

Each dose group included five subjects who were randomly assigned to receive an inactive placebo and another 12 to 15 men who received DMAU. Subjects took the drug or placebo for 28 days once daily with food. DMAU must be taken with food to be effective, Page noted.</p><p>A total of 83 men completed the study, including giving blood samples, for hormone and cholesterol testing, on the first and last days of the study.</p><p>At the highest dose of DMAU tested, 400 mg, subjects showed “marked suppression” of levels of their testosterone and two hormones required for sperm production. The low levels, Page said, are consistent with effective male contraception shown in longer-term studies.</p><p>“Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said.</p><p>All groups taking DMAU did have weight gain and decreases in HDL (“good”) cholesterol, both of which Page said were mild. All subjects passed safety tests, including markers of liver and kidney function.</p><p>“These promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill,” Page said. “Longer term studies are currently under way to confirm that DMAU taken every day blocks sperm production.”</p></ul></div>",
